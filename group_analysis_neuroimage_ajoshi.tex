\subsection{brainsync transform}

The recently developed Brainsync transform is an orthogonal transform
\cite{descoteaux_brainsync:_2017,joshi_are_2018} which can be used
for comparisons of fMRI scans across subjects that are collected during
resting state or task. In contrast with existing fMRI analysis methods,
this transform does not involve dimensionality reduction and also
preserves the rich dynamical information in fMRI scans. The method
is based on the observation that rfMRI data exhibit similar overall
connectivity patterns across subjects, as reflected in the pairwise
correlations between different brain regions (Figure \ref{fig:brainsync-transform-illustartion}).
As an input, the following illustration assumes preprocessed fMRI
data, sampled on the cortical surface or in the grayordinate coordinate
system developed by the Human Connectome Project team \cite{glasser_minimal_2013}.
The time series at each voxel was normalized to mean zero and unit
variance. Due to normalization, (zero mean, unit variance) the rfMRI
time series data can be represented as a set of labeled points on
the hypersphere. The similarity of resting connectivity patterns across
subjects (reflecting the existence of common networks: default mode,
visual, somatomotor, etc) results in clusters of points on the hypersphere,
separated from each other by a distance that reflects the correlation
between the corresponding time series. As a result, each subject's
data can be represented as a set of points on the hypersphere, differing
(approximately) across subjects by a rotation and or reflection of
the sphere. Alignment of time series across subjects can, therefore,
be approximately achieved by rotating their respective hyperspheres
so that they match. This process is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:brainsync-transform-illustartion}
and is the basis for the BrainSync transform. The BrainSync mapping
between subjects requires the solution of a Procrustes least-squares
fit \cite{gower_procrustes_2004,ten_berge_orthogonal_1977} to compute
an orthogonal matrix of dimension equal to the number of images making
up the fMRI time-series. While the synchronization makes the time
courses of the two datasets similar, individual variation is retained
after the transformation as manifested in the differences in spatial
activation patterns between the reference and synchronized subject
data. This is to be expected and is an important feature of the proposed
transform: the BrainSync transform aligns the components of the spatiotemporal
data that are common (with respect to their representation in the
hypersphere) but also retains any individual differences. The BrainSync
transform is unique, invertible, efficient to compute, and preserves
the connectivity structure of the original data for all subjects.
Similar to image registration, where we spatially align the anatomical
brain images, synchronization of fMRI signals by the BrainSync transform,
across a population or within-subject across sessions, facilitates
longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of fMRI.

This transform was developed to be able to compare two resting state
scans, for within or across subjects. In its original form, it has
following limitations. 1. The scans that are being synchronized need
to have the same number of time points. The entire scans were `synchronized'
in order to compare them. 2. The temporal dynamics is not captured
within resting state, however across subject deviation from the average
dynamics can be captured.

In this work, we develop a weighted extension of the BrainSync transform
with a scaling factor, that facilitates study of temporal dynamics
within scan.

\caption{Illustration of the BrainSync concept: (a) Data from motor (red),
cingulate (green) and visual (blue) areas was considered. Representation
of this data on a hypersphere is depicted. Dimensionality reduction
was performed using PCA. (b) Two datasets (subject and reference)
from these areas was used as input to PCA. Dimensionality of the data
was reduced to 3D and renormalized to generate the mapping to sphere.
Application of BrainSync to the subject results in a configuration
of data on the sphere very similar to that for the reference dataset.
The lower figure shows representative resting fMRI time-series for
two subjects for a single cortical location before and after synchronization.
Note the strong correlation of the blue and red time-series curves
from the two different subjects after synchronization. \label{fig:brainsync-transform-illustartion}}
