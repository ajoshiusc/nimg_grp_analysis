	abstract = {In conventional resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) analysis, functional connectivity is assumed to be temporally stationary, overlooking neural activities or interactions that may happen within the scan duration. Dynamic changes of neural interactions can be reflected by variations of topology and correlation strength in temporally correlated functional connectivity networks. These connectivity networks may potentially capture subtle yet short neural connectivity disruptions induced by disease pathologies. Accordingly, we are motivated to utilize disrupted temporal network properties for improving control-patient classification performance. Specifically, a sliding window approach is firstly employed to generate a sequence of overlapping R-fMRI sub-series. Based on these sub-series, sliding window correlations, which characterize the neural interactions between brain regions, are then computed to construct a series of temporal networks. Individual estimation of these temporal networks using conventional network construction approaches fails to take into consideration intrinsic temporal smoothness among successive overlapping R-fMRI sub-series. To preserve temporal smoothness of R-fMRI sub-series, we suggest to jointly estimate the temporal networks by maximizing a penalized log likelihood using a fused sparse learning algorithm. This sparse learning algorithm encourages temporally correlated networks to have similar network topology and correlation strengths. We design a disease identification framework based on the estimated temporal networks, and group level network property differences and classification results demonstrate the importance of including temporally dynamic R-fMRI scan information to improve diagnosis accuracy of mild cognitive impairment patients.},

	abstract = {Studies of resting state functional MRI (rs-fRMI) are increasingly focused on ″dynamics″, or on those properties of brain activation that manifest and vary on timescales shorter than the scan′s full duration. This shift in focus has led to a flurry of interest in developing hypothesis testing frameworks and null models applicable to the dynamical setting. Thus far however, these efforts have been weakened by a number of crucial shortcomings that are outlined and discussed in this short paper. We focus here on aspects of recently proposed null models that, we argue, are poorly formulated relative to the hypotheses they are designed to test, i.e. their potential role in separating functionally relevant BOLD signal dynamics from noise or intermittent background and maintenance type processes is limited by factors that are fundamental rather than merely quantitative or parametric. In this short position paper, we emphasize that (1) serious care must be exercised in building null models for rs-fMRI dynamics from distributionally stationary univariate or multivariate timeseries, i.e. timeseries whose values are each independently drawn from one pre-specified probability distribution; and (2) measures such as kurtosis that quantify over-concentration of observed values in the far tails of some reference distribution may not be particularly suitable for capturing signal features most plausibly contributing to functionally relevant brain dynamics. Other metrics targeted, for example, at capturing the epochal temporal variation that contributes heavily to dynamic functional connectivity estimates and is and often taken as a signature of brain responsiveness to stimuli or experimental tasks, could play a more scientifically clarifying role. As we learn more about the phenomenon of functionally relevant brain dynamics and its imaging correlates, scientifically meaningful null hypotheses and well-tuned null models will naturally emerge. We also revisit the important concept of distributional stationarity, discuss how it manifests within realizations versus across multiple realizations, and provide guidance on the benefits and limitations of employing this type of stationarity in modeling the absence or functionally relevant temporal dynamics in resting state fMRI. We hope that the discussions herein are useful, and promote thoughtful consideration of these important issues.},

Here, we investigated emotions induced by music using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a data-driven approach based on intersubject correlations (ISC). This method allowed us to identify moments in the music that produced similar brain activity (i.e. synchrony) among listeners under relatively natural listening conditions. Continuous ratings of subjective pleasantness and arousal elicited by the music were also obtained for the music outside of the scanner. Our results reveal synchronous activations in left amygdala, left insula and right caudate nucleus that were associated with higher arousal, whereas positive valence ratings correlated with decreases in amygdala and caudate activity. Additional analyses showed that synchronous amygdala responses were driven by energy-related features in the music such as root mean square and dissonance, while synchrony in insula was additionally sensitive to acoustic event density. Intersubject synchrony also occurred in the left nucleus accumbens, a region critically implicated in reward processing. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of an approach based on ISC to explore the temporal dynamics of music perception and emotion in naturalistic conditions.},

	abstract = {Music is a powerful means for communicating emotions among individuals. Here we reveal that this continuous stream of affective information is commonly represented in the brains of different listeners and that particular musical attributes mediate this link. We examined participants' brain responses to two naturalistic musical pieces using functional Magnetic Resonance imaging (fMRI). Following scanning, as participants listened to the musical pieces for a second time, they continuously indicated their emotional experience on scales of valence and arousal. These continuous reports were used along with a detailed annotation of the musical features, to predict a novel index of Dynamic Common Activation (DCA) derived from ten large-scale data-driven functional networks. We found an association between the unfolding music-induced emotionality and the DCA modulation within a vast network of limbic regions. The limbic-DCA modulation further corresponded with continuous changes in two temporal musical features: beat-strength and tempo. Remarkably, this “collective limbic sensitivity” to temporal features was found to mediate the link between limbic-DCA and the reported emotionality. An additional association with the emotional experience was found in a left fronto-parietal network, but only among a sub-group of participants with a high level of musical experience ({\textgreater}5years). These findings may indicate two processing-levels underlying the unfolding of common music emotionality; (1) a widely shared core-affective process that is confined to a limbic network and mediated by temporal regularities in music and (2) an experience based process that is rooted in a left fronto-parietal network that may involve functioning of the ‘mirror-neuron system’.},

	abstract = {We aimed at determining the functional neuroanatomy of working memory (WM) recognition of musical motifs that occurs while listening to music by adopting a non-standard procedure. Western tonal music provides naturally occurring repetition and variation of motifs. These serve as WM triggers, thus allowing us to study the phenomenon of motif tracking within real music. Adopting a modern tango as stimulus, a behavioural test helped to identify the stimulus motifs and build a time-course regressor of WM neural responses. This regressor was then correlated with the participants' (musicians') functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal obtained during a continuous listening condition. In order to fine-tune the identification of WM processes in the brain, the variance accounted for by the sensory processing of a set of the stimulus' acoustic features was pruned from participants' neurovascular responses to music. Motivic repetitions activated prefrontal and motor cortical areas, basal ganglia, medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures, and cerebellum. The findings suggest that WM processing of motifs while listening to music emerges from the integration of neural activity distributed over cognitive, motor and limbic subsystems. The recruitment of the hippocampus stands as a novel finding in auditory WM. Effective connectivity and agglomerative hierarchical clustering analyses indicate that the hippocampal connectivity is modulated by motif repetitions, showing strong connections with WM-relevant areas (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex – dlPFC, supplementary motor area – SMA, and cerebellum), which supports the role of the hippocampus in the encoding of the musical motifs in WM, and may evidence long-term memory (LTM) formation, enabled by the use of a realistic listening condition.},

	abstract = {Cerebello-hippocampal interactions occur during accurate spatiotemporal prediction of movements. In the context of music listening, differences in cerebello-hippocampal functional connectivity may result from differences in predictive listening accuracy. Using functional MRI, we studied differences in this network between 18 musicians and 18 nonmusicians while they listened to music. Musicians possess a predictive listening advantage over nonmusicians, facilitated by strengthened coupling between produced and heard sounds through lifelong musical experience. Thus, we hypothesized that musicians would exhibit greater functional connectivity than nonmusicians as a marker of accurate online predictions during music listening. To this end, we estimated the functional connectivity between cerebellum and hippocampus as modulated by a perceptual measure of the predictability of the music. Results revealed increased predictability-driven functional connectivity in this network in musicians compared with nonmusicians, which was positively correlated with the length of musical training.

	abstract = {Movie viewing allows human perception and cognition to be studied in complex, real-life-like situations in a brain-imaging laboratory. Previous studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG and EEG) have demonstrated consistent temporal dynamics of brain activity across movie viewers. However, little is known about the similarities and differences of fMRI and MEG or EEG dynamics during such naturalistic situations. We thus compared MEG and fMRI responses to the same 15-min black-and-white movie in the same eight subjects who watched the movie twice during both MEG and fMRI recordings. We analyzed intra- and intersubject voxel-wise correlations within each imaging modality as well as the correlation of the MEG envelopes and fMRI signals. The fMRI signals showed voxel-wise within- and between-subjects correlations up to r = 0.66 and r = 0.37, respectively, whereas these correlations were clearly weaker for the envelopes of band-pass filtered (7 frequency bands below 100 Hz) MEG signals (within-subjects correlation r {\textless} 0.14 and between-subjects r {\textless} 0.05). Direct MEG–fMRI voxel-wise correlations were unreliable. Notably, applying a spatial-filtering approach to the MEG data uncovered consistent canonical variates that showed considerably stronger (up to r = 0.25) between-subjects correlations than the univariate voxel-wise analysis. Furthermore, the envelopes of the time courses of these variates up to about 10 Hz showed association with fMRI signals in a general linear model. Similarities between envelopes of MEG canonical variates and fMRI voxel time-courses were seen mostly in occipital, but also in temporal and frontal brain regions, whereas intra- and intersubject correlations for MEG and fMRI separately were strongest only in the occipital areas. In contrast to the conventional univariate analysis, the spatial-filtering approach was able to uncover associations between the MEG envelopes and fMRI time courses, shedding light on the similarities of hemodynamic and electromagnetic brain activities during movie viewing.},

	abstract = {Low-level (timbral) and high-level (tonal and rhythmical) musical features during continuous listening to music, studied by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have been shown to elicit large-scale responses in cognitive, motor, and limbic brain networks. Using a similar methodological approach and a similar group of participants, we aimed to study the replicability of previous findings. Participants’ fMRI responses during continuous listening of a tango Nuevo piece were correlated voxelwise against the time series of a set of perceptually validated musical features computationally extracted from the music. The replicability of previous results and the present study was assessed by two approaches: (a) correlating the respective activation maps, and (b) computing the overlap of active voxels between datasets at variable levels of ranked significance. Activity elicited by timbral features was better replicable than activity elicited by tonal and rhythmical ones. These results indicate more reliable processing mechanisms for low-level musical features as compared to more high-level features. The processing of such high-level features is probably more sensitive to the state and traits of the listeners, as well as of their background in music.},

	abstract = {Understanding movies and stories requires maintaining a high-level situation model that abstracts away from perceptual details to describe the location, characters, actions, and causal relationships of the currently unfolding event. These models are built not only from information present in the current narrative, but also from prior knowledge about schematic event scripts, which describe typical event sequences encountered throughout a lifetime. We analyzed fMRI data from 44 human subjects (male and female) presented with 16 three-minute stories, consisting of four schematic events drawn from two different scripts (eating at a restaurant or going through the airport). Aside from this shared script structure, the stories varied widely in terms of their characters and storylines, and were presented in two highly dissimilar formats (audiovisual clips or spoken narration). One group was presented with the stories in an intact temporal sequence, while a separate control group was presented with the same events in scrambled order. Regions including the posterior medial cortex, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and superior frontal gyrus exhibited schematic event patterns that generalized across stories, subjects, and modalities. Patterns in mPFC were also sensitive to overall script structure, with temporally scrambled events evoking weaker schematic representations. Using a Hidden Markov Model, patterns in these regions predicted the script (restaurant vs airport) of unlabeled data with high accuracy and were used to temporally align multiple stories with a shared script. These results extend work on the perception of controlled, artificial schemas in human and animal experiments to naturalistic perception of complex narratives.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In almost all situations we encounter in our daily lives, we are able to draw on our schematic knowledge about what typically happens in the world to better perceive and mentally represent our ongoing experiences. In contrast to previous studies that investigated schematic cognition using simple, artificial associations, we measured brain activity from subjects watching movies and listening to stories depicting restaurant or airport experiences. Our results reveal a network of brain regions that is sensitive to the shared temporal structure of these naturalistic situations. These regions abstract away from the particular details of each story, activating a representation of the general type of situation being perceived.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

This shape manifold has some nice properties--it is equipped with a Riemannian L2 metric on the tangent space and facilitates computational analyses and correspondences between sulcal shapes. Sulcal mapping is achieved by computing geodesics in the quotient space of shapes modulo rigid rotations and reparameterizations. The resulting sulcal shape atlas is shown to preserve important local geometry inherently present in the sample population. This is demonstrated in our experimental results for deep brain sulci, where we integrate the elastic shape model into surface registration framework for a population of 69 healthy young adult subjects.},

A reliable measure of this general ability, also known as intelligence, can be derived from scores across a diverse set of cognitive tasks. There is great interest in understanding the neural underpinnings of individual differences in intelligence, since it is the single best predictor of long-term life success. The most replicated neural correlate of human intelligence to date is total brain volume; however, this coarse morphometric correlate says little about function. Here we ask whether measurements of the activity of the resting brain (resting-state fMRI) might also carry information about intelligence. We used the final release of the Young Adult Human Connectome Project (N=884 subjects after exclusions), providing a full hour of resting-state fMRI per subject; controlled for gender, age, and brain volume; and derived a reliable estimate of general intelligence from scores on multiple cognitive tasks. Using a cross-validated predictive framework, we predicted 20\% of the variance in general intelligence in the sampled population from their resting-state connectivity matrices. Interestingly, no single anatomical structure or network was responsible or necessary for this prediction, which instead relied on redundant information distributed across the brain.},

In contrast to these approaches, we propose a novel framework for studying the geometry of the entire cortical sheet, subsuming its folding and thickness characteristics. We propose a novel descriptor of local cortical geometry to increase robustness to partial homology and misregistration. The proposed descriptor lies on a Riemannian manifold, and we describe a method for hypothesis testing on manifolds for cross-sectional studies.

Sub-voxel measurements of thickness are possible using sub-sampling and interpolation of the image information. The method is applied to repeated MRI scans of a single subject from two MRI scanners to demonstrate its robustness and reproducibility. A simulated data set is used to show that small focal differences in thickness between two groups of subjects can be detected. We propose that the analysis of VBCT maps can provide results that are complementary to other anatomical analyses such as voxel-based morphometry.},

Monozygotic co-twins were significantly more alike than control pairs of unrelated twins matched from the same sample. Sulcal depth influenced sulcal similarity, with deeper sulci being more similar than superficial sulci. This was true both for the pairs of related co-twins and for the unrelated pairs, although the sulcal depth effect was stronger for the related twins. Our results indicate that the shape of deep (ontogenetically early) sulci of the human brain is more strongly predetermined than that of superficial sulci. The finding that sulcal similarity increased with sulcal depth especially within monozygotic twin pairs should stimulate further investigations of the relative importance of genetic versus shared environmental morphogenetic factors that must account for this result. In addition, we found that subjects with similar brain shape also have more similar sulcal patterns, suggesting that both features are the result of ontogenetically related processes. Sulcal comparisons across the entire sample suggested that the left posterior lateral hemispheric surface may be the least variable brain area. Methodologically, these results were obtained by the representation of sulci as three-dimensional polygonal lines (termed 'sulcal cuts') that are extracted automatically from MRI data sets using new image analysis techniques.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: People with schizophrenia exhibit abnormalities in brain structure, often in the left hemisphere. Disturbed structural lateralization is controversial, however, and effects appear mediated by gender. The authors mapped differences between schizophrenic and normal subjects in gyral asymmetries, complexity, and variability across the entire cortex. METHOD: Asymmetry and shape profiles for 25 schizophrenic patients (15 men) and 28 demographically similar normal subjects (15 men) were obtained for 38 gyral regions, including the sylvian fissure and temporal and postcentral gyri, by using magnetic resonance data and a novel surface-based mesh-modeling approach. Cortical complexity was examined for sex and diagnosis effects in lobar regions. Intragroup variability was quantified and visualized to assess regional group abnormalities at the cortical surface. RESULTS: The patients showed greater variability in frontal areas than the comparison subjects. They also had significant deviations in gyral complexity asymmetry in the superior frontal cortex. In temporoparietal regions, significant gyral asymmetries were present in both groups. Sex differences were apparent in superior temporal gyral measures, and cortical complexity in inferior frontal regions was significantly greater in men. CONCLUSIONS: Cortical variability and complexity show regional abnormalities in the frontal cortex potentially specific to schizophrenia. The results indicate highly significant temporoparietal gyral asymmetries in both diagnostic groups, contrary to reports of less lateralization in schizophrenia. Substantially larger study groups are necessary to isolate smaller deviations in surface asymmetries, if present in schizophrenia, suggesting their diagnostic value is minimal.},

This approach is based on the paradigm that high curvature points usually possess an anatomical meaning, and are therefore good landmarks to guide the matching process, especially in the absence of a reliable physical or deformable geometric model of the observed structures. As Duncan's team, we therefore propose a method based on the minimization of an energy which tends to preserve the matching of high curvature points, while ensuring a smooth field of displacement vectors everywhere. The innovation of our work stems from the explicit description of the mapping between the curves to be matched, which ensures that the resulting displacement vectors actually map points belonging to the two curves, which was not the case in Duncan's approach. We have actually implemented the method in 2-D and we present the results of the tracking of a heart structure in a sequence of ultrasound images.},

(ii) We agree with him when he states that findings from VBM can pertain to systematic registration errors during spatial normalization. (iii) His argument about voxelwise tests on smooth data holds in the absence of error variance, but is of no consequence when using actual data. We first review the tenets of VBM, paying particular attention to the relationship between VBM and tensor-based morphometry.

This paper presents a fast, automatic, and robust variational framework for computing continuous, subvoxel accurate curve skeletons from volumetric objects. A reference point inside the object is considered a point source that transmits two wave fronts of different energies. The first front (beta-front) converts the object into a graph, from which the object salient topological nodes are determined. Curve skeletons are tracked from these nodes along the cost field constructed by the second front (alpha-front) until the point source is reached. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed work are validated against competing techniques as well as a database of 3D objects. Unlike other state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed framework is highly robust because it avoids locating and classifying skeletal junction nodes, employs a new energy that does not form medial surfaces, and finally extracts curve skeletons that correspond to the most prominent parts of the shape and hence are less sensitive to noise.},

This paper attempts to develop a coherent theoretical account of reserve. One convenient subdivision of reserve models revolves around whether they envision reserve as a passive process, such as in brain reserve or threshold, or see the brain as actively attempting to cope with or compensate for pathology, as in cognitive reserve. Cognitive reserve may be based on more efficient utilization of brain networks or of enhanced ability to recruit alternate brain networks as needed. A distinction is suggested between reserve, the ability to optimize or maximize normal performance, and compensation, an attempt to maximize performance in the face of brain damage by using brain structures or networks not engaged when the brain is not damaged. Epidemiologic and imaging data that help to develop and support the concept of reserve are presented.},

A statistical shape model, which includes a network of deformable curves on the unit sphere, seeks geometric features such as high curvature regions and labels such features via a deformation process that is confined within a spherical map of the outer brain boundary. The limitations of the customary spherical coordinate system, which include discontinuities at the poles and nonuniform sampling, are overcome by defining the statistical prior of shape variation in terms of projections of landmark points onto corresponding tangent planes of the sphere.

	abstract = {We present a novel, computerized method of examining cerebral cortical thickness. The normal cortex varies in thickness from 2 to 4 mm, reflecting the morphology of neuronal sublayers. Cortical pathologies often manifest abnormal variations in thickness, with examples of Alzheimer's disease and cortical dysplasia as thin and thick cortex, respectively. Radiologically, images are 2-D slices through a highly convoluted 3-D object. Depending on the relative orientation of the slices with respect to the object, it is impossible to deduce abnormal cortical thickness without additional information from neighboring slices. We approach the problem by applying Laplace's Equation (V2psi = 0) from mathematical physics. The volume of the cortex is represented as the domain for the solution of the differential equation, with separate boundary conditions at the gray-white junction and the gray-CSF junction. Normalized gradients of psi form a vector field, representing tangent vectors along field lines connecting both boundaries. We define the cortical thickness at any point in the cortex to be the pathlength along such lines. Key advantages of this method are that it is fully three-dimensional, and the thickness is uniquely defined for any point in the cortex. We present graphical results that map cortical thickness everywhere in a normal brain. Results show global variations in cortical thickness consistent with known neuroanatomy. The application of this technique to visualization of cortical thickness in brains with known pathology has broad clinical implications.},

Seventeen normal brains (male: 11, female: 6, age: 22-60) were systematically analyzed. Additionally, parameters generated by visual observation were recorded. Non-parametric statistics were performed to evaluate the variation of the STs and influence of side, handedness and sex. We found that the 3D architecture of the STs was consistent with our generic model in four sulcal roots and four "plis de passage" (PP) and significant differences between right and left hemispheres. These morphological differences may be related to the language-relevant cortical areas difference and are pertinent for defining the limits of morphometric variability of the STs in "normal humans". © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Second, we present several methods for computing the probabilities of point correspondences from the modes of the point proximity matrix. Third, we consider alternatives to the Gaussian proximity matrix. We evaluate the new method on both synthetic and real-world data. Here we show that the method can be used to compute useful correspondences even when the level of point contamination is as large as 50\%.

	abstract = {A framework for solving variational problems and partial differential equations that define maps onto a given generic manifold is introduced in this paper. We discuss the framework for arbitrary target manifolds, while the domain manifold problem was addressed in [J. Comput. Phys. 174(2) (2001) 759]. The key idea is to implicitly represent the target manifold as the level-set of a higher dimensional function, and then implement the equations in the Cartesian coordinate system where this embedding function is defined. In the case of variational problems, we restrict the search of the minimizing map to the class of maps whose target is the level-set of interest. In the case of partial differential equations, we re-write all the equation's geometric characteristics with respect to the embedding function. We then obtain a set of equations that, while defined on the whole Euclidean space, are intrinsic to the implicitly defined target manifold and map into it. This permits the use of classical numerical techniques in Cartesian grids, regardless of the geometry of the target manifold. The extension to open surfaces and submanifolds is addressed in this paper as well. In the latter case, the submanifold is defined as the intersection of two higher dimensional hypersurfaces, and all the computations are restricted to this intersection. Examples of the applications of the framework here described include harmonic maps in liquid crystals, where the target manifold is a hypersphere; probability maps, where the target manifold is a hyperplane; chroma enhancement; texture mapping; and general geometric mapping between high dimensional manifolds. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

To this end, graph theoretical analysis was applied to matrices of functional connectivity of beta band-filtered electroencephalography (EEG) channels, in 15 Alzheimer patients and 13 control subjects. Correlations between all pairwise combinations of EEG channels were determined with the synchronization likelihood. The resulting synchronization matrices were converted to graphs by applying a threshold, and cluster coefficients and path lengths were computed as a function of threshold or as a function of degree K. For a wide range of thresholds, the characteristic path length L was significantly longer in the Alzheimer patients, whereas the cluster coefficient C showed no significant changes. This pattern was still present when L and C were computed as a function of K. A longer path length with a relatively preserved cluster coefficient suggests a loss of complexity and a less optimal organization. The present study provides further support for the presence of "small-world" features in functional brain networks and demonstrates that AD is characterized by a loss of small-world network characteristics. Graph theoretical analysis may be a useful approach to study the complexity of patterns of interrelations between EEG channels.},

This paper proposes a novel approach for shape matching and modeling using the symmetry characterization of shape interior and the spatial relationships of shape structures. Based on the representative skeletal features, we develop a mechanism to generate a coarse segment matching between different instances of an object. Additionally, the natural correspondence of skeletal branches to sequential segments along the shape curves is employed in the matching process to avoid false correspondences across different segments. Point matches within the corresponding segments are then obtained by solving a constrained assignment problem. The validation of the proposed approach is illustrated on various data sets in the presence of considerable deformation and occlusion and the results are compared with those of popular approaches. We also demonstrate the performance of our method on biological objects for shape modeling, showing better models than those obtained by the state-of-the-art shape modeling approaches.},

Under stressful conditions, males have higher late fetal mortality than females, and their fetal growth generally has been found to be more retarded. Investigations of postnatal responses to environmental stress have yielded much less consistent results, in large part because of the fact that male children are given preferential treatment in many societies. Results of studies of differences between the sexes in their response to environmental improvement are contradictory. During the prenatal peroid males seem to show a greater response to nutritional supplementation, while postnatal catch-up growth is usually greater in females. Similarly, some investigations report larger secular trends in males, while others have found larger increases in females. These contradictory findings can be reconciled with the hypothesis of greater male environmental sensitivity, but they illustrate the need to obtain more specific information on the environment to which males and females are subject before the hypothesis can be tested adequately.},

In the quantitative analysis of the cortex from MR images, extracting the structure and obtaining a representation for various measurements are key steps. While manual segmentation is tedious and labor intensive, automatic reliable efficient segmentation and measurement of the cortex remain challenging problems, due to its convoluted nature. Here we present a new approach of coupled-surfaces propagation, using level set methods to address such problems. Our method is motivated by the nearly constant thickness of the cortical mantle and takes this tight coupling as an important constraint. By evolving two embedded surfaces simultaneously, each driven by its own image-derived information while maintaining the coupling, a final representation of the cortical bounding surfaces and an automatic segmentation of the cortex are achieved. Characteristics of the cortex, such as cortical surface area, surface curvature, and cortical thickness, are then evaluated. The level set implementation of surface propagation offers the advantage of easy initialization, computational efficiency, and the ability to capture deep sulcal folds.

Their contours are recovered and represented by a pair of N points obtained by linear interpolation. Given two points p"i and q"j from the two shapes the cost of their matching is evaluated by using the shape context and by using dynamic programming the best matching between the point sets is obtained. Dynamic programming not only recovers the best matching, but also identifies occlusions, i.e. points in the two shapes which cannot be properly matched. Given the correspondence between the two point sets, the two contours are aligned using Procrustes analysis. After alignment, each contour is transformed into a string of symbols and a modified version of edit distance is used to compute the similarity between strings of symbols. Finally, recognition and retrieval are obtained by a simple nearest-neighbor procedure. The algorithm has been tested on a large set of shape databases (Kimia, MPEG-7, natural silhouette database, gesture database, marine database, swedish leaf database, diatom database, ETH-80 3D object database) providing performances for both in recognition and in retrieval superior to most of previously proposed approaches.},

In the current study, 82 healthy young participants underwent MRI scanning and completed a comprehensive cognitive battery including measurements of fluid, crystallized, and spatial intelligence, along with working memory capacity/executive updating, controlled attention, and processing speed. The cognitive scores were obtained by confirmatory factor analyses. T1-weighted images were processed using three different surface-based morphometry (SBM) pipelines, varying in their degree of user intervention, for obtaining measures of cortical thickness (CT) across the brain surface. Distribution and variability of CT and CT-cognition relationships were systematically compared across pipelines and between two cognitively/demographically matched samples to overcome potential sources of variability affecting the reproducibility of findings. We demonstrated that estimation of CT was not consistent across methods. In addition, among SBM methods, there was considerable variation in the spatial pattern of CT-cognition relationships. Finally, within each SBM method, results did not replicate in matched subsamples.},

	abstract = {In vivo MRI-derived measurements of human cerebral cortex thickness are providing novel insights into normal and abnormal neuroanatomy, but little is known about their reliability. We investigated how the reliability of cortical thickness measurements is affected by MRI instrument-related factors, including scanner field strength, manufacturer, upgrade and pulse sequence. Several data processing factors were also studied. Two test-retest data sets were analyzed: 1) 15 healthy older subjects scanned four times at 2-week intervals on three scanners; 2) 5 subjects scanned before and after a major scanner upgrade. Within-scanner variability of global cortical thickness measurements was {\textbackslash}textless0.03 mm, and the point-wise standard deviation of measurement error was approximately 0.12 mm. Variability was 0.15 mm and 0.17 mm in average, respectively, for cross-scanner (Siemens/GE) and cross-field strength (1.5 T/3 T) comparisons. Scanner upgrade did not increase variability nor introduce bias. Measurements across field strength, however, were slightly biased (thicker at 3 T). The number of (single vs. multiple averaged) acquisitions had a negligible effect on reliability, but the use of a different pulse sequence had a larger impact, as did different parameters employed in data processing. Sample size estimates indicate that regional cortical thickness difference of 0.2 mm between two different groups could be identified with as few as 7 subjects per group, and a difference of 0.1 mm could be detected with 26 subjects per group. These results demonstrate that MRI-derived cortical thickness measures are highly reliable when MRI instrument and data processing factors are controlled but that it is important to consider these factors in the design of multi-site or longitudinal studies, such as clinical drug trials.},

Against a background of long-standing disputes, effects of gender and handedness on callosal size, shape, and variability were additionally examined. Both positive and negative correlations between sulcal asymmetry and callosal size were observed, with effects influenced by sex and handedness. The direction of relationships, however, were dependent on the regional asymmetry measured and on whether real or absolute values were used to quantify sulcal asymmetries. Callosal measurements showed no significant effects of sex or handedness, although subtle differences in callosal shape were observed in anterior and posterior regions between males and females and surface variability was increased in males. Individual variations in callosal size appear to outrange any detectable divergences in size between groups. Relationships between sulcal asymmetries and callosal size, however, are influenced by both sex and handedness. Whether magnitudes of asymmetry are related to increases or decreases in callosal size appears dependent on the chosen indicators of asymmetry. It is an oversimplification, therefore, to assume a single relationship exists between cerebral asymmetries and callosal connections.},

	abstract = {This chapter highlights the basic AI paradigms of dealing with uncertainty and describes the unique qualitative features that make probability theory a loyal guardian of plausible reasoning. AI researchers tackling the problems of uncertainty in AI can be classified into three formal schools: (1) logicist, (2) neo-calculist, and (3) neo-probabilist. The logicist school attempts to deal with uncertainty using nonnumerical techniques, primarily, nonmonotonic logic. The neo-calculist school uses numerical representations of uncertainty but regards probability calculus as inadequate for the task and, thus, invents entirely new calculi such as the Dempster–Shafer calculus, fuzzy logic, and certainty factors. The neo-probabilists remain within the traditional framework of probability theory, while attempting to buttress the theory with computational facilities needed to perform AI tasks. The extensional approach of dealing with uncertainty, also known as production systems, rule-based systems, and procedure-based systems, treats uncertainty as a generalized truth value attached to formulas and computes the uncertainty of any formula as a function of the uncertainties of its subformulas. In the intentional approach, also known as declarative or model-based, uncertainty is attached to states of affairs or subsets of possible worlds.},

This representation makes it very easy to automatically evaluate the functional parameters and myocardial kinetics of the heart, since quantitative analysis can be followed in a simple way. In the model, local deformation and motion on the cardiac shape are expressed in adjustable parameters. Especially, an effective integral algorithm is used for volumetric measurement of a NURBS shape since the volume is the most basic parameter in cardiac functional analysis. This method promises the numerical computation to be very convenient, efficient, and accurate, in comparison with traditional methods. Practical experiments are carried out, and results show that the algorithm can get satisfactory measurement accuracy and efficiency. The parametric NURBS model in cylindrical coordinates is not only very suitable to fit the anatomical surfaces of a cardiac shape, but also easy for geometric transformation and nonrigid registration, and able to represent local dynamics and kinetics, and thus, can easily be applied for quantitative and functional analysis of the heart.},

	abstract = {This study reports the first comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) maps of cortical patterns in children. Using a novel parametric mesh-based analytic technique applied to high-resolution T1-weighted MRI scans, we examined age (6-16 years) and gender differences in cortical complexity (the fractal dimension or complexity of sulcal/gyral convolutions) and asymmetry of 24 primary cortical sulci in normally developing children (N = 24). Three-dimensional models of the cerebral cortex were extracted and major sulci mapped in stereotaxic space. Given the documented age-related changes in frontal lobe functions and several neuroimaging studies that have reported accompanying volumetric changes in these regions, we hypothesized that, with age, we would find continued modifications of the cerebrum in frontal cortex. We also predicted that phylogenetically older regions of the cerebrum, such as olfactory cortex, would be less variable in anatomic location across subjects and with age. Age-related increases in cortical complexity were found in both left and right inferior frontal and left superior frontal regions, possibly indicating an increase in secondary branching with age in these regions. Moreover, a significant increase in the length of the left inferior frontal sulcus and a posterior shifting of the left pre-central sulcus was associated with age. Three-dimensional asymmetry and anatomic variability maps revealed a significant left-greater-than-right asymmetry of the Sylvian fissures and superior temporal sulci, and increased variance in dorsolateral frontal and perisylvian areas relative to ventral regions of the cortex. These results suggest increases in cortical complexity and subtle modifications of sulcal topography of frontal lobe regions, likely reflecting ongoing processes such as myelination and synaptic remodeling that continue into the second decade of life. More studies in a larger sample set and/or longitudinal design are needed to address the issues of normal individual variation and sulcal development. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

We optimized a TBM-based image analysis method to determine what methodological factors, and which image-derived measures, maximize statistical power to track brain change. 3D maps, tracking rates of structural atrophy over time, were created from 1030 longitudinal brain MRI scans (1-year follow-up) of 104 AD patients (age: 75.7 ± 7.2 years; MMSE: 23.3 ± 1.8, at baseline), 254 amnestic MCI subjects (75.0 ± 7.2 years; 27.0 ± 1.8), and 157 healthy elderly subjects (75.9 ± 5.1 years; 29.1 ± 1.0), as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). To determine which TBM designs gave greatest statistical power, we compared different linear and nonlinear registration parameters (including different regularization functions), and different numerical summary measures derived from the maps. Detection power was greatly enhanced by summarizing changes in a statistically-defined region-of-interest (ROI) derived from an independent training sample of 22 AD patients. Effect sizes were compared using cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots and false discovery rate methods. In power analyses, the best method required only 48 AD and 88 MCI subjects to give 80\% power to detect a 25\% reduction in the mean annual change using a two-sided test (at α = 0.05). This is a drastic sample size reduction relative to using clinical scores as outcome measures (619 AD/6797 MCI for the ADAS-Cog, and 408 AD/796 MCI for the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes scores).

These methods have been evaluated with phantom data as well as with patient data. We have improved these correlation methods by using more landmarks and special selection criteria.

Contour deformation is explicitly incorporated in the computation, allowing for a thorough use of all geometric information available. Moreover, no discretization is involved in the computation, resulting in two main advantages: first, the algorithm is robust to differences in the segmentation of contours and allows the matching of polygonal approximations of contours with very little loss of precision, second, subpixel precision matching can be achieved},

Here, we examined whether this functional organization is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Task-free fMRI data from 21 AD subjects and 18 age-matched controls were obtained. Wavelet analysis was applied to the fMRI data to compute frequency-dependent correlation matrices. Correlation matrices were thresholded to create 90-node undirected-graphs of functional brain networks. Small-world metrics (characteristic path length and clustering coefficient) were computed using graph analytical methods. In the low frequency interval 0.01 to 0.05 Hz, functional brain networks in controls showed small-world organization of brain activity, characterized by a high clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length. In contrast, functional brain networks in AD showed loss of small-world properties, characterized by a significantly lower clustering coefficient (p{\textbackslash}textless0.01), indicative of disrupted local connectivity. Clustering coefficients for the left and right hippocampus were significantly lower (p{\textbackslash}textless0.01) in the AD group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the clustering coefficient distinguished AD participants from the controls with a sensitivity of 72\% and specificity of 78\%. Our study provides new evidence that there is disrupted organization of functional brain networks in AD. Small-world metrics can characterize the functional organization of the brain in AD, and our findings further suggest that these network measures may be useful as an imaging-based biomarker to distinguish AD from healthy aging.},

The shape analysis pipeline injects the global shape properties of the CFA subcortical template into the subcortical parcellations generated from FreeSurfer via large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM). Examples are shown for this injection in several subcortical structures whose raw MR images were sampled from the database of Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). The shape analysis is performed on random field representation of the template surface momentum maps that encode the shape variation of subcortical structure targets of each individual subject relative to the template. The momentum maps have the optimum property that they are supported only on the boundary of the subcortical structures with the direction normal to the subcortical nuclei boundary thereby reducing the dimension of shape variation significantly. A two-level statistical model was built on these momentum maps to assess anatomical connectivity among the subcortical structures on the basis of similar surface deformation (compression or expansion). Results in the study of healthy aging on the hippocampus-amygdala network indicate the anatomical connectivity between the basolateral complex of the amygdala and the subiculum of the hippocampus on the basis of shape compression in healthy elders relative to young adults. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We present here a combination of these two cases, creating a level-set representation for curves constrained to lie on surfaces. We study primarily geometrically based motions of these curves on stationary surfaces while allowing topological changes in the curves (i.e., merging and breaking) to occur. Applications include finding geodesic curves and shortest paths and curve shortening on surfaces. Further applications can be arrived at by extending those for curves moving in R2 to surfaces. The problem of moving curves on surfaces can also be viewed as a simple constraint problem and may be useful in studying more difficult versions. Results show that our representation can accurately handle many geometrically based motions of curves on a wide variety of surfaces while automatically enforcing topological changes in the curves when they occur and automatically fixing the curves to lie on the surfaces. The method can also be easily extended to higher dimensions.},

We detect characteristic network building blocks (structural and functional motifs) in neuroanatomical data sets and identify a small set of structural motifs that occur in significantly increased numbers. Our analysis suggests the hypothesis that brain networks maximize both the number and the diversity of functional motifs, while the repertoire of structural motifs remains small. Using functional motif number as a cost function in an optimization algorithm, we obtain network topologies that resemble real brain networks across a broad spectrum of structural measures, including small-world attributes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that highly evolved neural architectures are organized to maximize functional repertoires and to support highly efficient integration of information.},

In this paper, only the grey matter segmentation together with the cortical thickness estimation is described. In contrast to many existing methods, our estimation method is voxel-based and does not use any surface meshes. While this fact poses a principal limit on the accuracy that can be achieved by our method, it offers tremendous advantages with respect to practical applicability. In particular, it is applicable to data sets showing severe cortical atrophies that involve areas of high curvature and extremely thin gyral stalks. In contrast to many other methods, it is entirely automatic and very fast with computation times of a few minutes. Our method has been used in two clinical studies involving a total of 27 patients and 23 healthy subjects.},

The model shape is implicitly embedded in a higher dimensional space of distance transforms, thus represented by a distance map image. In this way, both shape and appearance of the model are defined in the pixel space.

This algorithm automatically determines the cortical thickness by 3-D extraction of the inner and outer surfaces of the cerebral cortex from an MRI scan. A manual method of tagging the grey-csf and grey-white interface was used on 20 regions (10 cortical areas found in each hemisphere) in 40 MRIs of the brain to validate the algorithm. The regions were chosen throughout the cortex to get broad assessment of the algorithm's performance. Accuracy was determined by an anatomist tagging the csf-grey and grey-white borders of selected gyri and by allowing the algorithm to determine the csf-grey and grey-white borders and the corresponding cortical thickness of the same region. Results from the manual and automatic methods were statistically compared using overall ANOVA and paired t tests for each region. The manual and automatic methods were in agreement for all but 4 of the 20 regions tested. The four regions where there were significant differences between the two methods were the insula left and right, the right cuneus, and the right parahippocampus. We conclude that the automatic algorithm is valid for most of the cortex and provides a viable alternative to manual methods of determining cortical thickness in vivo. However, caution should be taken when measuring the regions mentioned previously where the results of the algorithm can be biased by surrounding grey structures.},

In this study, we mapped age differences in structural asymmetries at the cortical surface in groups of normally developing children (7-11 years), adolescents (12-16 years) and young adults (23-30 years) using novel surface-based mesh modeling image analytic methods. We also assessed relationships between cortical surface sulcal asymmetry and the local density of the underlying cortical gray matter. Results from this study reveal that perisylvian sulcal asymmetries are much more prominent in the adults than in the children studied. The superior posterior extent of the Sylvian fissure in the right hemisphere is approximately 7 mm more superior in the average adult than in the average child studied, whereas little difference is observed during this age range in the location of this anatomical structure in the left hemisphere. Age-related differences in Sylvian fissure asymmetry were significant (P = 0.0129, permutation test), showing increased asymmetry with increasing age. We also show age-related increases in local gray matter proportion bilaterally in the temporo-parietal cortices that are anatomically and temporally related to the sulcal asymmetries. Results from this cross-sectional study imply that asymmetries in the Sylvian fissure are dynamically changing into young adulthood and show that variability in brain tissue density is related to asymmetry in this region. These morphological differences may be related to changing cognitive abilities and are relevant in interpreting results from studies of abnormal brain development where perisylvian brain regions are implicated.},

	abstract = {Integrated analyses of human anatomical and functional measurements offer a powerful paradigm for human brain mapping. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and EEG provide excellent temporal resolution of neural population dynamics as well as capabilities for source localization. Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides excellent spatial resolution of head and brain anatomy, whereas functional MRI (fMRI) techniques provide an alternative measure of neural activation based on associated hemodynamic changes. These methodologies constrain and complement each other and can thereby improve our interpretation of functional neural organization. We have developed a number of computational tools and techniques for the visualization, comparison, and integrated analysis of multiple neuroimaging techniques. Construction of geometric anatomical models from volumetric MRI data allows improved models of the head volume conductor and can provide powerful constraints for neural electromagnetic source modeling. These approaches, coupled to enhanced algorithmic strategies for the inverse problem, can significantly enhance the accuracy of source-localization procedures. We have begun to apply these techniques for studies of the functional organization of the human visual system. Such studies have demonstrated multiple, functionally distinct visual areas that can be resolved on the basis of their locations, temporal dynamics, and differential sensitivity to stimulus parameters. Our studies have also produced evidence of internal retinotopic organization in both striate and extrastriate visual areas but have disclosed organizational departures from classical models. Comparative studies of MEG and fMRI suggest a reasonable but imperfect correlation between electrophysiological and hemodynamic responses. We have demonstrated a method for the integrated analysis of fMRI and MEG, and we outline strategies for improvement of these methods. By combining multiple measurement techniques, we can exploit the complementary strengths and transcend the limitations of the individual neuro-imaging methods.},

	abstract = {This paper describes algorithms that can identify patterns of brain structure and function associated with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, normal aging, and abnormal brain development based on imaging data collected in large human populations. Extraordinary information can be discovered with these techniques: dynamic brain maps reveal how the brain grows in childhood, how it changes in disease, and how it responds to medication. Genetic brain maps can reveal genetic influences on brain structure, shedding light on the nature-nurture debate, and the mechanisms underlying inherited neurobehavioral disorders. Recently, we created time-lapse movies of brain structure for a variety of diseases. These identify complex, shifting patterns of brain structural deficits, revealing where, and at what rate, the path of brain deterioration in illness deviates from normal. Statistical criteria can then identify situations in which these changes are abnormally accelerated, or when medication or other interventions slow them. In this paper, we focus on describing our approaches to map structural changes in the cortex. These methods have already been used to reveal the profile of brain anomalies in studies of dementia, epilepsy, depression, childhood- and adult-onset schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, fetal alcohol syndrome, Tourette syndrome, Williams syndrome, and in methamphetamine abusers. Specifically, we describe an image analysis pipeline known as cortical pattern matching that helps compare and pool cortical data over time and across subjects. Statistics are then defined to identify brain structural differences between groups, including localized alterations in cortical thickness, gray matter density (GMD), and asymmetries in cortical organization. Subtle features, not seen in individual brain scans, often emerge when population-based brain data are averaged in this way. Illustrative examples are presented to show the profound effects of development and various diseases on the human cortex. Dynamically spreading waves of gray matter loss are tracked in dementia and schizophrenia, and these sequences are related to normally occurring changes in healthy subjects of various ages.},

Image registration is the process of overlaying images (two or more) of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors. The registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images). The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (area-based and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too. The major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source for the researchers involved in image registration, regardless of particular application areas. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Concepts from persistent homology are employed for a hierarchical representation, for the elimination of topological noise and for the comparison of eigenfunctions. The obtained parts can be registered via their spectral embedding across a population of near isometric shapes.

For maximum efficiency, voxelization is implemented as a sort-middle tile-based rasterizer, while the A-buffer mode, essentially performing 3D binning of triangles over uniform grids, uses a sort-last pipeline. Despite its major flexibility, the performance of our tile-based rasterizer is always competitive with and sometimes more than an order of magnitude superior to that of state-of-the-art binary voxelizers, whereas our bucketing system is up to 4 times faster than previous implementations.

Accurate and automatic delineation of the sulci is a challenging problem due to substantial variability in their shapes across populations. We present a geodesic curvature flow method for an automatic and accurate delineation of sulcal curves. We assume as input an atlas brain surface mesh on which a set of sulcal curves have been delineated. The sulcal curves are transferred to approximate corresponding locations on the subject brain using a transformation defined by an automatic surface based registration method. The locations of these curves are then refined to follow the true sulcal fundi more closely using geodesic curvature flow on the cortical surface. We present a level set based formulation of this flow on non-flat surfaces which represents the sulcal curves as zero level sets. We also incorporate a curvature based weighting that drives the sulcal curves to the bottoms of the sulcal valleys in the cortical folds. The resulting PDE is discretized on a triangulated mesh using finite elements. Finally, we present a validation by comparing sets of automatically delineated sul-cal curves with sets of manually delineated sulcal curves and show that the proposed method is able to find them accurately.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the performance of a new multivariate method for tensor-based morphometry (TBM). Statistics on Riemannian manifolds are developed that exploit the full information in deformation tensor fields. In TBM, multiple brain images are warped to a common neuroanatomical template via 3-D nonlinear registration; the resulting deformation fields are analyzed statistically to identify group differences in anatomy. Rather than study the Jacobian determinant (volume expansion factor) of these deformations, as is common, we retain the full deformation tensors and apply a manifold version of Hotelling's \$T(2) test to them, in a Log-Euclidean domain. In 2-D and 3-D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 26 HIV/AIDS patients and 14 matched healthy subjects, we compared multivariate tensor analysis versus univariate tests of simpler tensor-derived indices: the Jacobian determinant, the trace, geodesic anisotropy, and eigenvalues of the deformation tensor, and the angle of rotation of its eigenvectors. We detected consistent, but more extensive patterns of structural abnormalities, with multivariate tests on the full tensor manifold. Their improved power was established by analyzing cumulative p-value plots using false discovery rate (FDR) methods, appropriately controlling for false positives. This increased detection sensitivity may empower drug trials and large-scale studies of disease that use tensor-based morphometry.},

	abstract = {The cortical sulci are brain structures resembling thin convoluted ribbons embedded in three dimensions. The importance of the sulci lies primarily in their relation to the cytoarchitectonic and functional organization of the underlying cortex and in their utilization as features in non-rigid registration methods. This paper presents a methodology for extracting parametric representations of the cerebral sulcus from magnetic resonance images. The proposed methodology is based on deformable models utilizing characteristics of the cortical shape. Specifically, a parametric representation of a sulcus is determined by the motion of an active contour along the medial surface of the corresponding cortical fold. The active contour is initialized along the outer boundary of the brain and deforms toward the deep root of a sulcus under the influence of an external force field, restricting it to lie along the medial surface of the particular cortical fold. A parametric representation of the medial surface of the sulcus is obtained as the active contour traverses the sulcus. Based on the first fundamental form of this representation, the location and degree of an interruption of a sulcus can be readily quantified; based on its second fundamental form, shape properties of the sulcus can be determined. This methodology is tested on magnetic resonance images and it is applied to three medical imaging problems: quantitative morphological analysis of the central sulcus; mapping of functional activation along the primary motor cortex and non-rigid registration of brain images.},

The starting point is to impose a curvilinear coordinate system, named the Darcyan coordinate system, on facial surfaces; it is based on the level curves of the surface distance function measured from the tip of the nose. Each facial surface is now represented as an indexed collection of these level curves. The task of finding optimal deformations, or geodesic paths, between facial surfaces reduces to that of finding geodesics between level curves, which is accomplished using the theory of elastic shape analysis of 3D curves. The elastic framework allows for nonlinear matching between curves and between points across curves. The resulting geodesics between facial surfaces provide optimal elastic deformations between faces and an elastic metric for comparing facial shapes. We demonstrate this idea using examples from FSU face database.},

A chronic disease model of AD is presented that is based on the convergence of epidemiologic, clinicopathologic, genetic, and molecular findings in regard to AD. Given that years of education are unlikely to alter underlying pathogenetic events, the key question is whether no or low education enables the clinician to diagnose dementia at an earlier point in time. During the last decade, the introduction of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III (DSM-III) criteria for diagnosis of dementia, the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke, and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for diagnosis of AD have led to a marked improvement in accuracy of diagnosis. The most critical question that needs to be explored is whether education actually increases neocortical synaptic density.},

A novel framework for isotropic and anisotropic diffusion of directions is presented in this paper. The framework can be applied both to denoise directional data and to obtain multiscale representations of it. The basic idea is to apply and extend results from the theory of harmonic maps, and in particular, harmonic maps in liquid crystals. This theory deals with the regularization of vectorial data, while satisfying the intrinsic unit norm constraint of directional data. We show the corresponding variational and partial differential equations formulations for isotropic diffusion, obtained from an L2 norm, and edge preserving diffusion, obtained from an L norm in general and an L1 norm in particular. In contrast with previous approaches, the framework is valid for directions in any dimensions, supports non-smooth data, and gives both isotropic and anisotropic formulations. In addition, the framework of harmonic maps here described can be used to diffuse and analyze general image data defined on general non-flat manifolds, that is, functions between two general manifolds. We present a number of theoretical results, open questions, and examples for gradient vectors, optical flow, and color images.},

The complexity and variability of brain structure, especially in the gyral patterns of the human cortex, present challenges in creating standardized brain atlases that reflect the anatomy of a population. This paper introduces the concept of a population-based, disease-specific brain atlas that can reflect the unique anatomy and physiology of a particular clinical subpopulation. Based on well-characterized patient groups, disease-specific atlases contain thousands of structure models, composite maps, average templates, and visualizations of structural variability, asymmetry and group-specific differences. They correlate the structural, metabolic, molecular and histologic hallmarks of the disease. Rather than simply fusing information from multiple subjects and sources, new mathematical strategies are introduced to resolve group-specific features not apparent in individual scans. High-dimensional elastic mappings, based on covariant partial differential equations, are developed to encode patterns of cortical variation. In the resulting brain atlas, disease-specific features and regional asymmetries emerge that are not apparent in individual anatomies. The resulting probabilistic atlas can identify patterns of altered structure and function, and can guide algorithms for knowledge-based image analysis, automated image labeling, tissue classification, data mining and functional image analysis.},

The exact properties of human shape similarity judgements are not well understood yet, and this task is particularly difficult in domains where the shapes are not related by rigid transformations. In this paper we identify a number of possibly desirable properties of a shape similarity method, and determine the extent to which these properties can be captured by approaches that compare local properties of the contours of the shapes, through elastic matching. Special attention is devoted to objects that possess articulations, i.e. articulated parts. Elastic matching evaluates the similarity of two shapes as the sum of local deformations needed to change one shape into another. We show that similarities of part structure can be captured by such an approach, without the explicit computation of part structure. This may be of importance, since although parts appear to play a significant role in visual recognition, it is difficult to stably determine part structure. We also show novel results about how one can evaluate smooth and polyhedral shapes with the same method. Finally, we describe shape similarity effects that cannot be handled by current approaches.},

Extreme variations in cortical anatomy, even among normal subjects, complicate the detection and mapping of systematic effects on brain structure in human populations. We tackle this problem in two stages. First, we develop a cortical pattern matching approach, based on metrically covariant partial differential equations (PDEs), to associate corresponding regions of cortex in an MRI brain image database (N=102 scans). Second, these high-dimensional deformation maps are used to transfer within-subject cortical signals, including measures of gray matter distribution, shape asymmetries, and degenerative rates, to a common anatomic template for statistical analysis. We illustrate these techniques in two applications: (1) mapping dynamic patterns of gray matter loss in longitudinally scanned Alzheimer's disease patients; and (2) mapping genetic influences on brain structure. We extend statistics used widely in behavioral genetics to cortical manifolds. Specifically, we introduce methods based on h-squared distributed random fields to map hereditary influences on brain structure in human populations.},

Specifically, we introduce a mathematical framework based on covariant partial differential equations (PDEs), pull-backs of mappings under harmonic flows, and high-dimensional random tensor fields to encode variations in cortical patterning, asymmetry and tissue distribution in a population-based brain image database (N =94 scans). We use this information to detect disease-specific abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, including dynamic changes over time. Illustrative examples are chosen to show how group patterns of cortical organization, asymmetry, and disease-specific trends can be resolved that are not apparent in individual brain images. Finally, we create four-dimensional (4D) maps that store probabilistic information on the dynamics of brain change in development and disease. Digital atlases that generate these maps show considerable promise in identifying general patterns of structural and functional variation in diseased populations, and revealing how these features depend on demographic, genetic, clinical and therapeutic parameters.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for computing curve skeletons for volumetric representations of the input models. Our algorithm consists of three major steps: 1) using iterative least squares optimization to shrink models and, at the same time, preserving their geometries and topologies, 2) extracting curve skeletons through the thinning algorithm, and 3) pruning unnecessary branches based on shrinking ratios. The proposed method is less sensitive to noise on the surface of models and can generate smoother skeletons. In addition, our shrinking algorithm requires little computation, since the optimization system can be factorized and stored in the pre-computational step. We demonstrate several extracted skeletons that help evaluate our algorithm. We also experimentally compare the proposed method with other well-known methods. Experimental results show advantages when using our method over other techniques.},

Specifically, given a subset S of oriented points, we introduce a variational definition for an oriented point that is most rotationally symmetric with respect to S. Our formulation effectively utilizes normal information to compensate for the missing data and leads to robust curve skeleton computation over regions of a shape that are generally cylindrical. We present an iterative algorithm via planar cuts to compute the ROSA of a point cloud. This is complemented by special handling of non-cylindrical joint regions to obtain a centered, topologically clean, and complete 1D skeleton. We demonstrate that quality curve skeletons can be extracted from a variety of shapes captured by incomplete point clouds. Finally, we show how our algorithm assists in shape completion under these challenges by developing a skeleton-driven point cloud completion scheme.},

	abstract = {Dynamic programming has been found useful for performing nonlinear time warping for matching patterns in automatic speech recognition. Here, this technique is applied to the problem of recognizing cursive script. The parameters used in the matching are derived from time sequences of x-y coordinate data of words handwritten on an electronic tablet. Chosen for their properties of invariance with respect to size and translation of the writing, these parameters are found particularly suitable for the elastic matching technique. A salient feature of the recognition system is the establishment, in a training procedure, of prototypes by each writer using the system. In this manner, the system is tailored to the user. Processing is performed on a word-by-word basis after the writing is separated into words. Using prototypes for each letter, the matching procedure allows any letter to follow any letter and finds the letter sequence which best fits the unknown word. A major advantage of this procedure is that it combines letter segmentation and recognition in one operation by, in essence, evaluating recognition at all possible segmentations, thus avoiding the usual segmentation-then-recognition philosophy. Results on cursive writing are presented where the alphabet is restricted to the lower-case letters. Letter recognition accuracy is over 95 percent for each of three writers.},

Previous research suggests that cortical folding and sulcal width are associated with cognitive function in elderly individuals, and the aim of the present study was to investigate these morphological measures in patients with AD. The sample contained 161 participants, comprising 80 normal controls, 57 patients with very mild AD, and 24 patients with mild AD. From 3D T1-weighted brain scans, automated methods were used to calculate an index of global cortex gyrification and the width of five individual sulci: superior frontal, intra-parietal, superior temporal, central, and Sylvian fissure. We found that global cortex gyrification decreased with increasing severity of AD, and that the width of all individual sulci investigated other than the intra-parietal sulcus was greater in patients with mild AD than in controls. We also found that cognitive functioning, as assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, decreased as global cortex gyrification decreased. MMSE scores also decreased in association with a widening of all individual sulci investigated other than the intra-parietal sulcus. The results suggest that abnormalities of global cortex gyrification and regional sulcal span are characteristic of patients with even very mild AD, and could thus facilitate the early diagnosis of this condition.},

SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. There-fore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

This inconsistency is a result of the matching criteria's inability to uniquely describe the correspondences between two images. This paper seeks to overcome this limitation by jointly estimating the transformation from A to B and from B to A while enforcing the consistency constraint that these transforms are inverses of one another. The transformations are further restricted to preserve topology by constraining them to obey the laws of continuum mechanics. A new parameterization of the transfor-mation based on a Fourier series in the context of linear elasticity is presented. Results are presented using both Magnetic Resonance and X-ray Computed Tomography Imagery. It is shown that joint estimation of a consistent set of forward and reverse transformations constrained by linear-elasticity gives better registration results than using either con-straint alone or none at all.},

Choline acetyltransferase and somatostatin were significantly reduced in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease as compared with age-matched nursing home control subjects, although the degree of the reduction was less severe than found in subjects less than 80 years of age. Ten subjects whose functional and cognitive performance was in the upper quintile of the nursing home residents, as good as or better than the performance of the upper quintile of residents without brain pathology (control subjects), showed the pathological features of mild Alzheimer's disease, with many neocortical plaques. Plaque counts were 80\% of those of demented patients with Alzheimer's disease. Choline acetyltransferase and somatostatin levels were intermediate between controls and demented patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Sulci, the spaces between the folds, define location on the cortex and provide a parcellation into anatomically distinct areas. A topic that has recently received increased attention is the segmentation of these sulci from magnetic resonance images, with most work focusing on extracting either the sulcal spaces between the folds or curve representations of sulci. Unlike these methods, we propose a technique that extracts actual regions of the cortical surface that surround sulci, which we call “sulcal regions.” The method is based on a watershed algorithm applied to a geodesic depth measure on the cortical surface. A well-known problem with the watershed algorithm is a tendency toward oversegmentation, meaning that a single region is segmented as several pieces. To address this problem, we propose a postprocessing algorithm that merges appropriate segments from the watershed algorithm. The sulcal regions are then manually labeled by simply selecting the appropriate regions with a mouse click and a preliminary study of sulcal depth is reported. Finally, a scheme is presented for computing a complete parcellation of the cortical surface.},

The algorithm, which can handle multichannel data and slice-by-slice constant intensity offsets, is initialized with information from a digital brain atlas about the a priori expected location of tissue classes. This allows full automation of the method without need for user interaction, yielding more objective and reproducible results.

A general method of deforming polyhedra is presented here, with two novel features. First, explicit prevention of self-intersecting surface geometries is provided, unlike conventional deformable models, which use regularization constraints to discourage but not necessarily prevent such behavior. Second, deformation of multiple surfaces with intersurface proximity constraints allows each surface to help guide other surfaces into place using model-based constraints such as expected thickness of an anatomic surface. These two features are used advantageously to identify automatically the total surface of the outer and inner boundaries of cerebral cortical gray matter from normal human MR images, accurately locating the depths of the sulci, even where noise and partial volume artifacts in the image obscure the visibility of sulci. The extracted surfaces are enforced to be simple two-dimensional manifolds (having the topology of a sphere), even though the data may have topological holes. This automatic 3-D cortex segmentation technique has been applied to 150 normal subjects, simultaneously extracting both the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid interface from each individual. The collection of surfaces has been used to create a spatial map of the mean and standard deviation for the location and the thickness of cortical gray matter. Three alternative criteria for defining cortical thickness at each cortical location were developed and compared. These results are shown to corroborate published postmortem and in vivo measurements of cortical thickness.},

	abstract = {Improvements in the spatial resolution of structural and functional MRI are beginning to enable analysis of intracortical structures such as heavily myelinated layers in 3D, a prerequisite for in-vivo parcellation of individual human brains. This parcellation can only be performed precisely if the profiles used in cortical analysis are anatomically meaningful. Profiles are often constructed as traverses that are perpendicular to computed laminae. In this case they are fully determined by these laminae. The aim of this study is to evaluate models for cortical laminae used so far and to establish a new model. Methods to model the laminae used so far include constructing laminae that keep a constant distance to the cortical boundaries, so-called equidistant laminae. Another way is to compute equipotentials between the cortical boundary surfaces with the Laplace equation. The Laplace profiles resulting from the gradients to the equipotentials were often-used because of their nice mathematical properties. However, the equipotentials these Laplacian profiles are constructed from and the equidistant laminae do not follow the anatomical layers observed using high resolution MRI of cadaver brain. To remedy this problem, we introduce a novel equi-volume model that derives from work by Bok (1929). He argued that cortical segments preserve their volume, while layer thickness changes to compensate cortical folding. We incorporate this preservation of volume in our new equi-volume model to generate a three-dimensional well-adapted undistorted coordinate system of the cortex. When defined by this well-adapted coordinate system, cortical depth is anatomically meaningful. We compare isocontours from these cortical depth values to locations of myelinated bands on high-resolution ex-vivo and in-vivo three-dimensional MR images. A similar comparison was performed with equipotentials computed with the Laplace equation and with equidistant isocontours. A quantitative evaluation of the equi-volume model using measured image intensities confirms that it provides a much better fit to observed cortical layering.},

We present a novel shape representation that characterizes the shape of a curve in terms of a coordinate system based on the eigensystem of the anisotropic Helmholtz equation. This representation has many desirable properties: stability, uniqueness and invariance to scaling and isometric transformation. Under this representation, we can find a point-wise shape distance between curves as well as a bijective smooth point-to-point correspondence. When the curves are sampled irregularly, we also present a fast and accurate computational method for solving the eigensystem using a finite element formulation. This shape representation is used to find symmetries between corresponding sulcal shapes between cortical hemispheres. For this purpose, we automatically generate 26 sulcal curves for 24 subject brains and then compute their invariant shape representation. Left-right sulcal shape symmetry as measured by the shape representation’s metric demonstrates the utility of the presented invariant representation for shape analysis of the cortical folding pattern.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Magnetic resonance (MRI) studies rely on sulcal boundaries to delineate the human entorhinal cortex (EC) and typically show that EC size is reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a predictor of future dementia. However, it is unknown if variations in the EC sulcal patterns are associated with AD. We classified the lateral EC sulcal boundary as either a rhinal or collateral pattern and tested the hypotheses that the rhinal pattern was (1) more common in AD and (2) associated with a smaller EC size. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MRI was used to determine the prevalence of the rhinal and collateral EC patterns in 421 subjects (212 AD, 107 old normal (ONL), and 102 young NL (YNL). Anatomical validation studies of normal subjects were conducted at postmortem in 34 brain hemispheres and in vivo with 21 MRI volume studies. EC pattern reliability was studied with MRI in both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: The rhinal pattern was more frequent in the right hemisphere in AD (47\%) compared with ONL (28\%, odds ratio = 2.25, P = 0.001). EC pattern was not related to ApoE genotype. The validations showed that the EC sulcal pattern was not associated with the neuronal number, surface area, or volume of the EC. In patients with antemortem MRI studied at postmortem it was equivalently determined, that EC patterns are reliably determined on MRI and do not change with the progressive atrophy of AD. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that the right hemisphere rhinal pattern is over represented in AD as compared with control. However, in normal subjects the EC rhinal pattern is not associated with a diminished EC tissue size. It remains to be demonstrated if the right EC rhinal sulcus pattern association with AD reflects genetic or developmental influences.},

	abstract = {Registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to match two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints. Virtually all large systems which evaluate images require the registration of images, or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific examples of systems where image registration is a significant component include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images, matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation, and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis. Over the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for various types of data and problems. These techniques have been independently studied for several different applications, resulting in a large body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship between the variations in the images and the type of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied. Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken. The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values, but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The third type of variations are differences in the images that are of interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes. Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed by registration, but they make registration more difficult since an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of feature space, similarity measure, search space, and search strategy which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem.},

A hand-drawn shape (symbol) can be used for various purposes, like, a command gesture, an input for authentication purpose, etc. Shape of a symbol is invariant to scale, translation, mirror-reflection and rotation of the symbol. Moments, like Zernike moments are often used to represent a symbol. Descriptors based on Zernike moments are rotation invariant, but since they are neither translation nor scale invariant, a normalization step as pre-processing is required. Apart from this, higher order Zernike moments are error prone. The present paper, proposes to use probability distributions of some local moments of lower order, as a representation scheme. Theoretically it is shown to possess all invariance properties. Experimentally, using the k-nearest neighbor classifier (with Kullback-Leibler distance), it is shown to perform better than Zernike moments based representation scheme.},

The methods for shape analysis and point representation of asymmetric folds are a few and tedious, although several methods exist for the analysis of the individual fold limbs, or symmetric folds. This article gives a rapid method that uses the Bézier curve tool, available in any common computer graphics software, for the analysis of a complete asymmetric fold and its representation in the two-dimensional frame. The new method is based on the reduction of variables in the parametric equations of a cubic Bézier curve. It makes the length of one Bézier handle zero, pins the end point of the other Bézier handle at the origin of the X - Y frame and drags its control point along the Y -axis to fit the Bézier curve on the given asymmetric fold. A Cartesian plot between normalized length of the Bézier handle and the lift, i. e., difference between the heights of the two inflection points, gives the unique point that represents the given asymmetric fold shape. We test the validity of the new method on several computer simulated asymmetric folds and demonstrate its usefulness with the help of a natural example.},

This scale-space stems from a diffusion equation geodesic to the cortical surface. The primal sketch is made up of objects defined from mean curvature minima and saddle points. The resulting sketch aims first at highlighting significant elementary cortical folds, second at representing the fold merging process during brain growth. The relevance of the framework is illustrated by the study of central sulcus sulcal roots from antenatal to adult age. Some results are proposed for ten different brains.

In particular, we explore the applicability of diffusion distances within the Gromov-Hausdorff framework. While the traditionally used geodesic distance exploits the shortest path between points on the surface, the diffusion distance averages all paths connecting the points. The diffusion distance constitutes an intrinsic metric which is robust, in particular, to topological changes. Such changes in the form of shortcuts, holes, and missing data may be a result of natural non-rigid deformations as well as acquisition and representation noise due to inaccurate surface construction. The presentation of the proposed framework is complemented with examples demonstrating that in addition to the relatively low complexity involved in the computation of the diffusion distances between surface points, its recognition and matching performances favorably compare to the classical geodesic distances in the presence of topological changes between the non-rigid shapes.},

We assume as input a set of labeled data points that lie on a set of parameterized topologically spherical surfaces that represent the cortical surfaces of multiple subjects. To perform analysis across subjects, we first co-register the coordinates from each surface to a cortical atlas using labeled sulcal maps as constraints. The registration minimizes a thin plate spline energy function on the deforming surface using covariant derivatives to solve the associated PDEs in the intrinsic geometry of the individual surface. The resulting warps are used to bring the functional data for multiple subjects into a common surface atlas coordinate system. We then present a novel method for performing statistical analysis of points on this atlas surface. We use the Green's function of the heat equation on the surface to model probability distributions and thus demonstrate the use of PDEs for statistical analysis in Riemannian manifolds. We describe methods for estimating the mean and variance of a set of points, such that the mean also lies in the manifold. We demonstrate the utility of this framework in the development of a maximum likelihood classifier for parcellation of somatosensory cortex in the atlas based on current dipole fits to MEG data, simulated to represent a somatotopic mapping of S1 sensory areas in multiple subjects.},

Method I include: extraction, autolysis, and acetone fractionation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The pool of cathepsin B from DEAE-cellulose is further purified by covalent chromatography on a column of aminophenylmercuric acetate coupled to Sepharose. Method II include: homogenization and cell fractionation gel; chromatography on Sephadex G-75; CM-Sephadex chromatography; chromatography of cathepsin L on concanavalin A-Sepharose. Cathepsin B can be with BZ-DL-Arg-NPhNO2 or Bz-Arg-2-NNap as substrate, wheras, Cathepsin H can be assayed selectively by use of an unblocked substrate such as Leu-NNap, Arg-NNap, or Arg-NMec.

	abstract = {Neurodevelopmental models for the pathology of schizophrenia propose both polygenetic and environmental risks, as well as early (pre/perinatal) and late (usually adolescent) developmental brain abnormalities. With the use of brain mapping algorithms, we detected striking anatomical profiles of accelerated gray matter loss in very early-onset schizophrenia; surprisingly, deficits moved in a dynamic pattern, enveloping increasing amounts of cortex throughout adolescence. Early-onset patients were rescanned prospectively with MRI, at 2-year intervals at three time points, to uncover the dynamics and timing of disease progression during adolescence. The earliest deficits were found in parietal brain regions, supporting visuospatial and associative thinking, where adult deficits are known to be mediated by environmental (nongenetic) factors. Over 5 years, these deficits progressed anteriorly into temporal lobes, engulfing sensorimotor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, and frontal eye fields. These emerging patterns correlated with psychotic symptom severity and mirrored the neuromotor, auditory, visual search, and frontal executive impairments in the disease. In temporal regions, gray matter loss was completely absent early in the disease but became pervasive later. Only the latest changes included dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyri, deficit regions found consistently in adult studies. These emerging dynamic patterns were (i) controlled for medication and IQ effects, (ii) replicated in independent groups of males and females, and (iii) charted in individuals and groups. The resulting mapping strategy reveals a shifting pattern of tissue loss in schizophrenia. Aspects of the anatomy and dynamics of disease are uncovered, in a changing profile that implicates genetic and nongenetic patterns of deficits.},

The stationary wavelet transform is used to make shapes rotation invariant.

An important error rate criterion on the discovered network is the false discovery rate (FDR), that is the expected ratio of the falsely 'discovered' connections to all those 'discovered'. Very recently, we have developed an algorithm that is able to control the FDR under a given level q at the limit of large sample size, and its modification that controlled the FDR accurately in simulations with moderate sample sizes [1]. However, the algorithms do not consider prior knowledge on the network structure, and can not be applied to models such as dynamic Bayesian networks. In this paper, we extend the algorithms to incorporate prior knowledge, and demonstrate how to apply the extended algorithm to learning the structure of dynamic Bayesian networks from continuous data. Its application to a real functional-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging (fMRI) data set revealed that Parkinson's disease patients' brain connectivities are normalized by L-dopa medication. This result is consistent with the fact that L-dopa has dramatic effects against bradykinesia and rigidity.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a method to extract \&\#x2018;Shape-DNA\&\#x2019;, a numerical fingerprint or signature, of any 2d or 3d manifold (surface or solid) by taking the eigenvalues (i.e. the spectrum) of its Laplace\&\#x2013;Beltrami operator. Employing the Laplace\&\#x2013;Beltrami spectra (not the spectra of the mesh Laplacian) as fingerprints of surfaces and solids is a novel approach. Since the spectrum is an isometry invariant, it is independent of the object's representation including parametrization and spatial position. Additionally, the eigenvalues can be normalized so that uniform scaling factors for the geometric objects can be obtained easily. Therefore, checking if two objects are isometric needs no prior alignment (registration/localization) of the objects but only a comparison of their spectra. In this paper, we describe the computation of the spectra and their comparison for objects represented by NURBS or other parametrized surfaces (possibly glued to each other), polygonal meshes as well as solid polyhedra. Exploiting the isometry invariance of the Laplace\&\#x2013;Beltrami operator we succeed in computing eigenvalues for smoothly bounded objects without discretization errors caused by approximation of the boundary. Furthermore, we present two non-isometric but isospectral solids that cannot be distinguished by the spectra of their bodies and present evidence that the spectra of their boundary shells can tell them apart. Moreover, we show the rapid convergence of the heat trace series and demonstrate that it is computationally feasible to extract geometrical data such as the volume, the boundary length and even the Euler characteristic from the numerically calculated eigenvalues. This fact not only confirms the accuracy of our computed eigenvalues, but also underlines the geometrical importance of the spectrum. With the help of this Shape-DNA, it is possible to support copyright protection, database retrieval and quality assessment of digital data representing surfaces and solids. A patent application based on ideas presented in this paper is pending.},

For instance, computing a parameterization of an object helps attaching information to it and converting between various representations. More generally, this family of problems may be thought of in terms of constructing structured function bases attached to surfaces. In this paper, we study a specific type of hierarchical function bases, defined by the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. When applied to a sphere, this function basis corresponds to the classical spherical harmonics. On more general objects, this defines a function basis well adapted to the geometry and the topology of the object. Based on physical analogies (vibration modes), we first give an intuitive view before explaining the underlying theory. We then explain in practice how to compute an approximation of the eigenfunctions of a differential operator, and show possible applications in geometry processing.},

Signature histogram and k th order augmented histogram have all invariance properties [17]. But,they are applicable only to convex shapes. This representation scheme assumes that centroid to contour distance is a functionof angle (with a predefined axis). This is not true for non-convex and open shapes, since for some angles there can be more than onecentroid to contour distance. The current paper does not make this assumption, but considers distribution of centroid tocontour distances. Further, to reduce the false positive rate, distribution of local variations of the centroid contour distancesare also considered.

	abstract = {We propose a novel framework, aspect space , to balance deformability and discriminability, which are often two competing factors in shape and image representations. In this framework, an object is embedded as a surface in a higher dimensional space with a parameter named aspect weight , which controls the importance of intensity in the embedding. We show that this framework naturally unifies existing important shape and image representations by adjusting the aspect weight and the embedding. More importantly, we find that the aspect weight implicitly controls the degree to which a representation handles deformation. Based on this idea, we present the aspect shape context , which extends shape context-based descriptors and adaptively selects the ” best” aspect weight for shape comparison. Another observation we have is the proposed descriptor nicely fits context-sensitive shape retrieval. The proposed methods are evaluated on two public datasets, MPEG7-CE-Shape-1 and Tari 1000, in comparison to state-of-the-art solutions. In the standard shape retrieval experiment using the MPEG7 CE-Shape-1 database, the new descriptor with context information achieves a bull's eye score of 95.96\%, which surpassed all previous results. In the Tari 1000 dataset, our methods significantly outperform previous tested methods as well.},

These spectral measures are isometry invariant and therefore allow for shape comparisons with minimal shape pre-processing. In particular, no registration, mapping, or remeshing is necessary. The discriminatory power of the 2D surface and 3D solid methods is demonstrated on a population of female caudate nuclei (a subcortical gray matter structure of the brain, involved in memory function, emotion processing, and learning) of normal control subjects and of subjects with schizotypal personality disorder. The behavior and properties of the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are discussed extensively for both the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition showing advantages of the Neumann vs. the Dirichlet spectra in 3D. Furthermore, topological analyses employing the Morse-Smale complex (on the surfaces) and the Reeb graph (in the solids) are performed on selected eigenfunctions, yielding shape descriptors, that are capable of localizing geometric properties and detecting shape differences by indirectly registering topological features such as critical points, level sets and integral lines of the gradient field across subjects. The use of these topological features of the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions in 2D and 3D for statistical shape analysis is novel.},

The shapes are represented by sparse-point or continuous-contour representations depending on the form of the data. We formulate the problem as probabilistic inference using a generative model and the EM algorithm. But this algorithm has problems with initialization and computing the E-step. To address these problems, we define a data-driven technique (discriminative model) which makes use of shape features. This gives a hybrid algorithm which combines the generative and discriminative models. The resulting algorithm is very fast, due to the effectiveness of shape-features for solving correspondence requiring only a few iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by testing it on standard datasets, such as MPEG7, for shape matching and by applying it to a range of matching, registration, and foreground/background segmentation problems.},

We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties.

A key objective is to generate a detailed in vivo mapping of functional connectivity in a large cohort of healthy adults (over 1000 subjects), and to make these datasets freely available for use by the neuroimaging community. In each subject we acquire a total of 1h of whole-brain rfMRI data at 3 T, with a spatial resolution of 2×2×2 mm and a temporal resolution of 0.7s, capitalizing on recent developments in slice-accelerated echo-planar imaging. We will also scan a subset of the cohort at higher field strength and resolution. In this paper we outline the work behind, and rationale for, decisions taken regarding the rfMRI data acquisition protocol and pre-processing pipelines, and present some initial results showing data quality and example functional connectivity analyses.},

For non-rigid matching, attention has rather focussed on the type of smoothing or physical model of deformation to be used. In this report, we propose to place the non-rigid matching problem into a minimization framework. We have developped our theoretical idea in the case of the least squares criterion, corresponding to the assumption that the intensities of points do not change over time, and we have implemented a first order gradient descent which, along with a multiresolution approach, minimizes this criterion- . We also prove that the «demons» algorithm, thought of until now as an as hoc matching technique, can be seen as an approximation of a second order gradient descent on this criterion. Analysis of the mechanisms of this gradient descent incites us to introduce two different weightings into the filters used to smooth the solution, which we called an a priori weighting improves the solution found for the minimization problem, which is shown by comparing results in a distance-roughness space, while the a posteriori weighting helps tackle the appearance or disappearance of matter and occlusions, both sensitive issues for non-rigid iconic methods.},

However, the problem is challenging and remains open, and more effort should be made to advance the state-of-the-art image registration methods for fMRI images. Inspired by the observation that common functional networks can be reconstructed from fMRI image across individuals, we propose a novel computational framework for simultaneous groupwise fMRI image registration by utilizing those common functional networks as references for spatial alignments. In this framework, firstly, individualized functional networks in each subject are inferred using Independent Component Analysis (ICA); secondly, congealing groupwise registration that takes entropy of stacked independent components (ICs) from all the subjects as objective function is applied to register individual functional maps for maximal matching. The proposed framework is evaluated by and applied to an Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) fMRI dataset and shows reasonably good results.},

Methods: A standardized multidisciplinary neurologic, cognitive, behavioral, and brain imaging evaluation was conducted on 199 VHIS veterans plus uninjured controls, some 30 to 35 years after injury, as part of phase 3 of this study.
Results: The prevalence of seizures (87 patients, 43.7\%) was similar to that found during phase 2 evaluations 20 years earlier, but 11 of 87 (12.6\%) reported very late onset of PTE after phase 2 (more than 14 years after injury). Those patients were not different from patients with earlier-onset PTE in any of the measures studied. Within the phase 3 cohort, the most common seizure type last experienced was complex partial seizures (31.0\%), with increasing frequency after injury. Of subjects with PTE, 88\% were receiving anticonvulsants. Left parietal lobe lesions and retained ferric metal fragments were associated with PTE in a logistic regression model. Total brain volume loss predicted seizure frequency.
Conclusions: Patients with PHI carry a high risk of PTE decades after their injury, and so require long-term medical follow-up. Lesion location, lesion size, and lesion type were predictors of PTE.},

This crucial task is typically carried out manually and is labor intensive, time consuming, subject to high inter- and intra-observer variability, and may result in topologically incorrect surfaces. We present a method, WRist Image Segmentation Toolkit (WRIST), for 3D semi-automated, rapid segmentation of the carpal bones of the wrist from MRI. In our method, the boundary of the bones were iteratively found using prior known anatomical constraints and a shape-detection level set. The parameters of the method were optimized using a training dataset of 48 manually segmented carpal bones and evaluated on 112 carpal bones which included both healthy participants without known wrist conditions and participants with thumb basilar osteoarthritis (OA). Manual segmentation by two expert human observers was considered as a reference. On the healthy subject dataset we obtained a Dice overlap of 93.0 ± 3.8, Jaccard Index of 87.3 ± 6.2, and a Hausdorff distance of 2.7 ± 3.4 mm, while on the OA dataset we obtained a Dice overlap of 90.7 ± 8.6, Jaccard Index of 83.0 ± 10.6, and a Hausdorff distance of 4.0 ± 4.4 mm. The short computational time of 20.8 s per bone (or 5.1 s per bone in the parallelized version) and the high agreement with the expert observers gives WRIST the potential to be utilized in musculoskeletal research.},

	title = {Which registration method for high resolution {fMRI} to explore hand movement cortical representation?},
	doi = {10.1109/ISBI.2012.6235642},
	abstract = {Progress in our understanding of brain functions relies on our capability to explore the human cortical surface at a fine scale (typically 1.5 mm isotropic at 3T). For this purpose, high accuracy is required for all processing steps from image acquisition to data analysis. For group studies, the high intersubject variability of the human cortices hampers their precise registration. Based on the hypothesis that function follows anatomy, accurate inter-subject sulci registration should result in precise alignment of corresponding functional regions and then improve the statistical significance of parametric maps. Converging evidence from intra-operative mapping, cytoarchitectony, and functional neuroimaging conclusively rely primary cortical regions to morphological landmarks. Thus, the so-called ”hand knob” landmark, a specific feature of the central sulcus (CS), consistently separates the primary motor cortex (M1), on its anterior bank, from the primary sensory cortex (S1) on its posterior bank. In an effort to define a dedicated processing pipeline for a fine non-invasive exploration of human M1, we compared four nonlinear registration methods applied on high resolution fMRI of basic hand movements. First, based on anatomical measures, we show how recent local or global diffeomorphic techniques improve the alignment of sulcal folds in M1. Second, with functional measures, we quantitatively evaluate their effect on the detection and localization of activation clusters at the population level. Based on such measures, we show that two diffeomorphic methods working globally (DAR℡) or including sulcal constraints (DISCO+DAR℡) improve activation detection and localization opening the way to a non-invasive exploration of the human hand motor cortex.},

	abstract = {The position of cortical areas can be approximately predicted from cortical surface folding patterns. However, there is extensive inter-subject variability in cortical folding patterns, prohibiting a one-to-one mapping of cortical folds in certain areas. In addition, the relationship between cortical area boundaries and the shape of the cortex is variable, and weaker for higher-order cortical areas. Current surface registration techniques align cortical folding patterns using sulcal landmarks or cortical curvature, for instance. The alignment of cortical areas by these techniques is thus inherently limited by the sole use of geometric similarity metrics. Magnetic resonance imaging T1 maps show intra-cortical contrast that reflects myelin content, and thus can be used to improve the alignment of cortical areas. In this article, we present a new symmetric diffeomorphic multi-contrast multi-scale surface registration (MMSR) technique that works with partially inflated surfaces in the level-set framework. MMSR generates a more precise alignment of cortical surface curvature in comparison to two widely recognized surface registration algorithms. The resulting overlap in gyrus labels is comparable to FreeSurfer. Most importantly, MMSR improves the alignment of cortical areas further by including T1 maps. As a first application, we present a group average T1 map at a uniquely high-resolution and multiple cortical depths, which reflects the myeloarchitecture of the cortex. MMSR can also be applied to other MR contrasts, such as functional and connectivity data.},

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few ({\textless};100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- {\textbar}{\textbar}},

Inter-subject correlation (ISC) has been used as a model-free analysis method to map the highly complex hemodynamic responses that are evoked during watching a movie. Here, we extended the ISC analysis to frequency domain using wavelet analysis combined with non-parametric permutation methods for making voxel-wise statistical inferences about frequency-band specific ISC. We applied these novel analysis methods to a dataset collected in our previous study where 12 subjects watched an emotionally engaging movie \&ldquo;Crash\&rdquo; during fMRI scanning. Our results suggest that several regions within the frontal and temporal lobes show ISC predominantly at low frequency bands, whereas visual cortical areas exhibit ISC also at higher frequencies. It is possible that these findings relate to recent observations of a cortical hierarchy of temporal receptive windows, or that the types of events processed in temporal and prefrontal cortical areas (e.g., social interactions) occur over longer time periods than the stimulus features processed in the visual areas. Software tools to perform frequency-specific ISC analysis, together with a visualization application, are available as open source Matlab code.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges of naturalistic neurosciences using movie-viewing experiments is how to interpret observed brain activations in relation to the multiplicity of time-locked stimulus features. As previous studies have shown less inter-subject synchronization across viewers of random video footage than story-driven films, new methods need to be developed for analysis of less story-driven contents. To optimize the linkage between our fMRI data collected during viewing of a deliberately non-narrative silent film ‘At Land’ by Maya Deren (1944) and its annotated content, we combined the method of elastic-net regularization with the model-driven linear regression and the well-established data-driven independent component analysis (ICA) and inter-subject correlation (ISC) methods. In the linear regression analysis, both IC and region-of-interest (ROI) time-series were fitted with time-series of a total of 36 binary-valued and one real-valued tactile annotation of film features. The elastic-net regularization and cross-validation were applied in the ordinary least-squares linear regression in order to avoid over-fitting due to the multicollinearity of regressors, the results were compared against both the partial least-squares (PLS) regression and the un-regularized full-model regression. Non-parametric permutation testing scheme was applied to evaluate the statistical significance of regression. We found statistically significant correlation between the annotation model and 9 ICs out of 40 ICs. Regression analysis was also repeated for a large set of cubic ROIs covering the grey matter. Both IC- and ROI-based regression analyses revealed activations in parietal and occipital regions, with additional smaller clusters in the frontal lobe. Furthermore, we found elastic-net based regression more sensitive than PLS and un-regularized regression since it detected a larger number of significant ICs and ROIs. Along with the ISC ranking methods, our regression analysis proved a feasible method for ordering the ICs based on their functional relevance to the annotated cinematic features. The novelty of our method is – in comparison to the hypothesis-driven manual pre-selection and observation of some individual regressors biased by choice – in applying data-driven approach to all content features simultaneously. We found especially the combination of regularized regression and ICA useful when analyzing fMRI data obtained using non-narrative movie stimulus with a large set of complex and correlated features.},

	abstract = {Requiring only minimal assumptions for validity, nonparametric permutation testing provides a flexible and intuitive methodology for the statistical analysis of data from functional neuroimaging experiments, at some computational expense. Introduced into the functional neuroimaging literature by Holmes et al. ([1996]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 16:7-22), the permutation approach readily accounts for the multiple comparisons problem implicit in the standard voxel-by-voxel hypothesis testing framework. When the appropriate assumptions hold, the nonparametric permutation approach gives results similar to those obtained from a comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach using a general linear model with multiple comparisons corrections derived from random field theory. For analyses with low degrees of freedom, such as single subject PET/SPECT experiments or multi-subject PET/SPECT or fMRI designs assessed for population effects, the nonparametric approach employing a locally pooled (smoothed) variance estimate can outperform the comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach. Thus, these nonparametric techniques can be used to verify the validity of less computationally expensive parametric approaches. Although the theory and relative advantages of permutation approaches have been discussed by various authors, there has been no accessible explication of the method, and no freely distributed software implementing it. Consequently, there have been few practical applications of the technique. This article, and the accompanying MATLAB software, attempts to address these issues. The standard nonparametric randomization and permutation testing ideas are developed at an accessible level, using practical examples from functional neuroimaging, and the extensions for multiple comparisons described. Three worked examples from PET and fMRI are presented, with discussion, and comparisons with standard parametric approaches made where appropriate. Practical considerations are given throughout, and relevant statistical concepts are expounded in appendices.},

Here we delineated brain networks subserving social perception under naturalistic conditions in 19 healthy humans who watched, during 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a set of 137 short (approximately 16 s each, total 27 min) audiovisual movie clips depicting pre-selected social signals. Two independent raters estimated how well each clip represented eight social features (faces, human bodies, biological motion, goal-oriented actions, emotion, social interaction, pain, and speech) and six filler features (places, objects, rigid motion, people not in social interaction, non-goal-oriented action, and non-human sounds) lacking social content. These ratings were used as predictors in the fMRI analysis. The posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) responded to all social features but not to any non-social features, and the anterior STS responded to all social features except bodies and biological motion. We also found four partially segregated, extended networks for processing of specific social signals: (1) a fronto-temporal network responding to multiple social categories, (2) a fronto-parietal network preferentially activated to bodies, motion, and pain, (3) a temporo-amygdalar network responding to faces, social interaction, and speech, and (4) a fronto-insular network responding to pain, emotions, social interactions, and speech.

We correlated these measures with brain responses of human volunteers viewing movies in an fMRI scanner. Early visual areas responded only to residual changes, thus lacking responses to equally large motion-induced changes, consistent with predictive coding. Motion activated V5+ (MT+), V3A, medial posterior parietal cortex (mPPC) and, weakly, lateral occipital cortex (LOC). V5+ responded to local/differential motion and depended on visual contrast, whereas mPPC responded to global flow spanning the whole visual field and was contrast independent. mPPC thus codes for flow compatible with unbiased heading estimation in natural scenes and for the comparison of visual flow with nonretinal, multimodal motion cues in it or downstream. mPPC was functionally connected to anterior portions of V5+, whereas laterally neighboring putative homologue of lateral intraparietal area (LIP) connected with frontal eye fields. Our results demonstrate a progression of selectivity from local and contrast-dependent motion processing in V5+ toward global and contrast-independent motion processing in mPPC. The function, connectivity, and anatomical neighborhood of mPPC imply several parallels to monkey ventral intraparietal area (VIP).},

We demonstrated the method in two retrospective studies: a prostate study that relates 3D dose distributions to failure, and an esophagus study that relates 2D surface dose distributions of the esophagus to acute esophagus toxicity. As a result, we were able to identify suspicious regions that are significantly associated with failure (prostate study) or toxicity (esophagus study). Permutation testing allows direct comparison of images from different patient categories and is a useful tool for data mining in radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become a major technique for studying cognitive function and its disruption in mental illness, including schizophrenia. The major proportion of imaging studies focused primarily upon identifying regions which hemodynamic response amplitudes covary with particular stimuli and differentiate between patient and control groups. In addition to such amplitude based comparisons, one can estimate temporal correlations and compute maps of functional connectivity between regions which include the variance associated with event-related responses as well as intrinsic fluctuations of hemodynamic activity. Functional connectivity maps can be computed by correlating all voxels with a seed region when a spatial prior is available. An alternative are multivariate decompositions such as independent component analysis (ICA) which extract multiple components, each of which is a spatially distinct map of voxels with a common time course. Recent work has shown that these networks are pervasive in relaxed resting and during task performance and hence provide robust measures of intact and disturbed brain activity. This in turn bears the prospect of yielding biomarkers for schizophrenia, which can be described both in terms of disrupted local processing as well as altered global connectivity between large-scale networks. In this review we will summarize functional connectivity measures with a focus upon work with ICA and discuss the meaning of intrinsic fluctuations. In addition, examples of how brain networks have been used for classification of disease will be shown. We present work with functional network connectivity, an approach that enables the evaluation of the interplay between multiple networks and how they are affected in disease. We conclude by discussing new variants of ICA for extracting maximally group discriminative networks from data. In summary, it is clear that identification of brain networks and their inter-relationships with fMRI has great potential to improve our understanding of schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Face perception in both humans and monkeys is thought to depend on neurons clustered in discrete, specialized brain regions. Because primates are frequently called upon to recognize and remember new individuals, the neuronal representation of faces in the brain might be expected to change over time. The functional properties of neurons in behaving animals are typically assessed over time periods ranging from minutes to hours, which amounts to a snapshot compared to a lifespan of a neuron. It therefore remains unclear how neuronal properties observed on a given day predict that same neuron's activity months or years later. Here we show that the macaque inferotemporal cortex contains face-selective cells that show virtually no change in their patterns of visual responses over time periods as long as one year. Using chronically implanted microwire electrodes guided by functional MRI targeting, we obtained distinct profiles of selectivity for face and nonface stimuli that served as fingerprints for individual neurons in the anterior fundus (AF) face patch within the superior temporal sulcus. Longitudinal tracking over a series of daily recording sessions revealed that face-selective neurons maintain consistent visual response profiles across months-long time spans despite the influence of ongoing daily experience. We propose that neurons in the AF face patch are specialized for aspects of face perception that demand stability as opposed to plasticity.},

	doi = {10.3389/fnsys.2013.00109},
	abstract = {One characteristic of natural visual behavior in humans is the frequent shifting of eye position. It has been argued that the characteristics of these eye movements can be used to distinguish between distinct modes of visual processing (Unema et al., 2005). These viewing modes would be distinguishable on the basis of the eye-movement parameters fixation duration and saccade amplitude and have been hypothesized to reflect the differential involvement of dorsal and ventral systems in saccade planning and information processing. According to this hypothesis, on the one hand, while in a "pre-attentive" or ambient mode, primarily scanning eye movements are made; in this mode fixation are relatively brief and saccades tends to be relatively large. On the other hand, in "attentive" focal mode, fixations last longer and saccades are relatively small, and result in viewing behavior which could be described as detailed inspection. Thus far, no neuroscientific basis exists to support the idea that such distinct viewing modes are indeed linked to processing in distinct cortical regions. Here, we used fixation-based event-related (FIBER) fMRI in combination with independent component analysis (ICA) to investigate the neural correlates of these viewing modes. While we find robust eye-movement-related activations, our results do not support the theory that the above mentioned viewing modes modulate dorsal and ventral processing. Instead, further analyses revealed that eye-movement characteristics such as saccade amplitude and fixation duration did differentially modulate activity in three clusters in early, ventromedial and ventrolateral visual cortex. In summary, we conclude that evaluating viewing behavior is crucial for unraveling cortical processing in natural vision.},

We then used voxelwise models to examine the cortical representation of 1,705 object and action categories. The first few dimensions of the underlying semantic space were recovered from the fit models by principal components analysis. Projection of the recovered semantic space onto cortical flat maps shows that semantic selectivity is organized into smooth gradients that cover much of visual and nonvisual cortex. Furthermore, both the recovered semantic space and the cortical organization of the space are shared across different individuals.},

To validate monkeys as a model for human attention during realistic free viewing, we contrasted human (n = 5) and monkey (n = 5) gaze behavior using 115 natural and artificial video clips. Monkeys exhibited broader ranges of saccadic endpoints and amplitudes and showed differences in fixation and intersaccadic intervals. We compared tendencies of both species to gaze toward scene elements with similar low-level visual attributes using two computational models--luminance contrast and saliency. Saliency was more predictive of both human and monkey gaze, predicting human saccades better than monkey saccades overall. Quantifying interobserver gaze consistency revealed that while humans were highly consistent, monkeys were more heterogeneous and were best predicted by the saliency model. To address these discrepancies, we further analyzed high-interest gaze targets--those locations simultaneously chosen by at least two monkeys. These were on average very similar to human gaze targets, both in terms of specific locations and saliency values. Although substantial quantitative differences were revealed, strong similarities existed between both species, especially when focusing analysis onto high-interest targets.},

We analyzed the encoding data for intersubject correlations (ISC) based on subjects' subsequent memory (ISC-SM) performance to identify brain regions whose BOLD response is significantly more correlated across subjects during portions of the movie that are successfully as compared to unsuccessfully encoded. These regions include the parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, anterior temporal poles, and the temporal-parietal junction. Further analyses reveal (1) that these correlated regions can display distinct activation profiles and (2) that the results seen with the ISC-SM analysis are complementary to more traditional linear models and allow analysis of complex time course data.

Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally efficient for both early vision and higher visual processing.},

	abstract = {Visual motion responses in the brain are shaped by two distinct sources: the physical movement of objects in the environment and motion resulting from one's own actions. The latter source, termed visual reafference, stems from movements of the head and body, and in primates from the frequent saccadic eye movements that mark natural vision. To study the relative contribution of reafferent and stimulus motion during natural vision, we measured fMRI activity in the brains of two macaques as they freely viewed {\textgreater}50 hours of naturalistic video footage depicting dynamic social interactions. We used eye movements obtained during scanning to estimate the level of reafferent retinal motion at each moment in time. We also estimated the net stimulus motion by analyzing the video content during the same time periods. Mapping the responses to these distinct sources of retinal motion, we found a striking dissociation in the distribution of visual responses throughout the brain. Reafferent motion drove fMRI activity in the early retinotopic areas V1, V2, V3, and V4, particularly in their central visual field representations, as well as lateral aspects of the caudal inferotemporal cortex (area TEO). However, stimulus motion dominated fMRI responses in the superior temporal sulcus, including areas MT, MST, and FST as well as more rostral areas. We discuss this pronounced separation of motion processing in the context of natural vision, saccadic suppression, and the brain's utilization of corollary discharge signals.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Visual motion arises not only from events in the external world, but also from the movements of the observer. For example, even if objects are stationary in the world, the act of walking through a room or shifting one's eyes causes motion on the retina. This "reafferent" motion propagates into the brain as signals that must be interpreted in the context of real object motion. The delineation of whole-brain responses to stimulus versus self-generated retinal motion signals is critical for understanding visual perception and is of pragmatic importance given the increasing use of naturalistic viewing paradigms. The present study uses fMRI to demonstrate that the brain exhibits a fundamentally different pattern of responses to these two sources of retinal motion.},

We aimed to extend these findings of intersubject correlation to temporally accurate single-trial magnetoencephalography (MEG).

We adopted a spatial filtering model and estimated its parameter values by using multi-set canonical correlation analysis (M-CCA) so that the intersubject correlation was maximized. The procedure resulted in multiple (mutually uncorrelated) time-courses with statistically significant intersubject correlations at frequencies below 10Hz; the maximum correlation was 0.28±0.075 in the ≤1Hz band. Moreover, the 24-Hz frame rate elicited steady-state responses with statistically significant intersubject correlations up to 0.29±0.12. To assess the brain origin of the across-subjects correlated signals, the time-courses were correlated with minimum-norm source current estimates (MNEs) projected to the cortex. The time series implied across-subjects synchronous activity in the early visual, posterior and inferior parietal, lateral temporo-occipital, and motor cortices, and in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) bilaterally. These findings demonstrate the capability of the proposed methodology to uncover cortical MEG signatures from single-trial signals that are consistent across spectators of a movie.},

Large transient responses were observed when the activity was segmented, and these responses were mediated by changes in the observed activity, including characters and their interactions, interactions with objects, spatial location, goals, and causes.

We then annotated auditory and visual features of the motion picture to inform analysis of the hemodynamic data. The annotations were fitted to both voxel-wise data and brain network time courses extracted by independent component analysis (ICA). Auditory annotations correlated with two independent components (IC) disclosing two functional networks, one responding to variety of auditory stimulation and another responding preferentially to speech but parts of the network also responding to non-verbal communication. Visual feature annotations correlated with four ICs delineating visual areas according to their sensitivity to different visual stimulus features. In comparison, a separate voxel-wise general linear model based analysis disclosed brain areas preferentially responding to sound energy, speech, music, visual contrast edges, body motion and hand motion which largely overlapped the results revealed by ICA. Differences between the results of IC- and voxel-based analyses demonstrate that thorough analysis of voxel time courses is important for understanding the activity of specific sub-areas of the functional networks, while ICA is a valuable tool for revealing novel information about functional connectivity which need not be explained by the predefined model. Our results encourage the use of naturalistic stimuli and tasks in cognitive neuroimaging to study how the brain processes stimuli in rich natural environments.},

We observed significant between-subjects correlation of fMRI activity in especially right hemisphere frontal cortical areas, in addition to the correlation of activity in temporal, occipital, and parietal areas. It is possible that this resulted from the subjects following the plot of the movie and being emotionally engaged in the movie during fMRI scanning.

Brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during free viewing of films, and inter-subject correlation analysis (ISC) was used to assess similarities in the spatiotemporal responses across viewers' brains during movie watching. Our results demonstrate that some films can exert considerable control over brain activity and eye movements. However, this was not the case for all types of motion picture sequences, and the level of control over viewers' brain activity differed as a function of movie content, editing, and directing style. We propose that ISC may be useful to film studies by providing a quantitative neuroscientific assessment of the impact of different styles of filmmaking on viewers' brains, and a valuable method for the film industry to better assess its products. Finally, we suggest that this method brings together two separate and largely unrelated disciplines, cognitive neuroscience and film studies, and may open the way for a new interdisciplinary field of “neurocinematic” studies.},

Here we show that the cerebral cortex can also be subdivided into different components temporally, without any a priori hypotheses, based on the principle of functional independence. This states that distinct functional subdivisions have activity time courses (ATCs) that are, if not independent, at least characteristic to each when the brain is exposed to natural conditions. To approach a time-based anatomy experimentally, we recorded whole-brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and analyzed the data with independent component analysis (ICA). Our results show that a multitude of cortical areas can be identified based purely on their characteristic ATCs during natural conditions. We demonstrate that a more "rich" stimulation (free viewing of a movie) leads to more areas being activated in a specific way than conventional stimuli, allowing for a more detailed dissection of the cortex into its subdivisions. We show that stimulus-driven functionally specialized areas can be identified by intersubject correlation even if their function is unknown. Chronoarchitectonic mapping thus opens the prospect of identifying previously unknown cortical subdivisions based on natural viewing conditions by exploiting the characteristic temporal "fingerprint" that is unique to each.},

	abstract = {Previous imaging studies have used mostly perceptually abstracted, idealized, or static stimuli to show segregation of function in the cerebral cortex. We wanted to learn whether functional segregation is maintained during more natural, complex, and dynamic conditions when many features have to be processed simultaneously, and identify regions whose activity correlates with the perception of specific features. To achieve this, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity when human observers viewed freely dynamic natural scenes (a James Bond movie). The intensity with which they perceived different features (color, faces, language, and human bodies) was assessed psychometrically in separate sessions. In all subjects different features were perceived with a high degree of independence over time. We found that the perception of each feature correlated with activity in separate, specialized areas whose activity also varied independently. We conclude that even in natural conditions, when many features have to be processed simultaneously, functional specialization is preserved. Our method thus opens a new way of brain mapping, which allows the localization of a multitude of brain areas based on a single experiment using uncontrolled, natural stimuli. Furthermore, our results show that the intensity of activity in a specialized area is linearly correlated with the intensity of its perceptual experience. This leads us to suggest that each specialized area is directly responsible for the creation of a feature-specific conscious percept (a microconsciousness). Hum.

These spectral measures are isometry invariant and therefore allow for shape comparisons with minimal shape pre-processing. In particular, no registration, mapping, or remeshing is necessary. The discriminatory power of the 2D surface and 3D solid methods is demonstrated on a population of female caudate nuclei (a subcortical gray matter structure of the brain, involved in memory function, emotion processing, and learning) of normal control subjects and of subjects with schizotypal personality disorder. The behavior and properties of the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are discussed extensively for both the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition showing advantages of the Neumann vs. the Dirichlet spectra in 3D. Furthermore, topological analyses employing the Morse-Smale complex (on the surfaces) and the Reeb graph (in the solids) are performed on selected eigenfunctions, yielding shape descriptors, that are capable of localizing geometric properties and detecting shape differences by indirectly registering topological features such as critical points, level sets and integral lines of the gradient field across subjects. The use of these topological features of the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions in 2D and 3D for statistical shape analysis is novel. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Interestingly, recent advances in the acquisition and analysis of functional neuroimaging data have catalyzed the exploration of functional connectivity in the human brain. Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal dependency of neuronal activation patterns of anatomically separated brain regions and in the past years an increasing body of neuroimaging studies has started to explore functional connectivity by measuring the level of co-activation of resting-state fMRI time-series between brain regions. These studies have revealed interesting new findings about the functional connections of specific brain regions and local networks, as well as important new insights in the overall organization of functional communication in the brain network. Here we present an overview of these new methods and discuss how they have led to new insights in core aspects of the human brain, providing an overview of these novel imaging techniques and their implication to neuroscience. We discuss the use of spontaneous resting-state fMRI in determining functional connectivity, discuss suggested origins of these signals, how functional connections tend to be related to structural connections in the brain network and how functional brain communication may form a key role in cognitive performance. Furthermore, we will discuss the upcoming field of examining functional connectivity patterns using graph theory, focusing on the overall organization of the functional brain network. Specifically, we will discuss the value of these new functional connectivity tools in examining believed connectivity diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis.},

Typically, registration approaches assume a strong association between the features used for alignment, such as macro-anatomy, and the variable observed, such as functional activation or connectivity. Here, we propose to use the structure of intrinsic resting state fMRI signal correlation patterns as a basis for alignment of the cortex in functional studies. Rather than assuming the spatial correspondence of functional structures between subjects, we have identified locations with similar connectivity profiles across subjects. We mapped functional connectivity relationships within the brain into an embedding space, and aligned the resulting maps of multiple subjects. We then performed a diffeomorphic alignment of the cortical surfaces, driven by the corresponding features in the joint embedding space. Results show that functional alignment based on resting state fMRI identifies functionally homologous regions across individuals with higher accuracy than alignment based on the spatial correspondence of anatomy. Further, functional alignment enables measurement of the strength of the anatomo-functional link across the cortex, and reveals the uneven distribution of this link. Stronger anatomo-functional dissociation was found in higher association areas compared to primary sensory- and motor areas. Functional alignment based on resting state features improves group analysis of task based functional MRI data, increasing statistical power and improving the delineation of task-specific core regions. Finally, a comparison of the anatomo-functional dissociation between cohorts is demonstrated with a group of left and right handed subjects.},

We derive a common model space for the whole cortex using a new algorithm, searchlight hyperalignment, and complex, dynamic stimuli that provide a broad sampling of visual, auditory, and social percepts. The model aligns representations across brains in occipital, temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices, as shown by between-subject multivariate pattern classification and intersubject correlation of representational geometry, indicating that structural principles for shared neural representations apply across widely divergent domains of information. The model provides a rigorous account for individual variability of well-known coarse-scale topographies, such as retinotopy and category selectivity, and goes further to account for fine-scale patterns that are multiplexed with coarse-scale topographies and carry finer distinctions.},

Rather, they interact with other such elements through their afferent and efferent connections in an orchestrated manner so as to enable different sensorimotor and cognitive tasks to be performed. The concept of functional connectivity and the allied notion of effective connectivity were introduced to designate the functional strengths of such interactions. Functional neuroimaging methods, especially PET and fMRI, have been used extensively to evaluate the functional connectivity between different brain regions. After providing a brief historical review of these notions of brain connectivity, I argue that the conceptual formulations of functional and effective connectivity are far from clear. Specifically, the terms functional and effective connectivity are applied to quantities computed on types of functional imaging data (e.g., PET, fMRI, EEG) that vary in spatial, temporal, and other features, using different definitions (even for data of the same modality) and employing different computational algorithms. Until it is understood what each definition means in terms of an underlying neural substrate, comparisons of functional and/or effective connectivity across studies may appear inconsistent and should be performed with great caution.},

Simple activation maps depict only the average level of engagement of different regions within distributed systems. FMRI potentially can reveal additional information about the degree by which components of large-scale neural systems are functionally coupled together to achieve specific tasks. In order to better understand how brain regions contribute to functionally connected circuits, it is necessary to record activation maps either as a function of different conditions, at different times or in different subjects. Data obtained under different conditions may then be analyzed by a variety of techniques to infer correlations and couplings between nodes in networks. Several different multivariate statistical methods have been adapted and applied to analyze the variations within such data. An approach of particular interest that is suited to studies of connectivity within single subjects makes use of acquisitions of runs of MRI images obtained while the brain is in a so-called steady state, either at rest (i.e. without any specific stimulus or task) or in a condition of continuous activation. The interregional correlations between fluctuations of MRI signal potentially reveal functional connectivity. Recent studies have established that interregional correlations between different components of circuits in each of the visual, language, motor and working memory systems can be detected in the resting state. The correlations at baseline are changed during the performance of a continuous task. In this review the various methods available for assessing connectivity are described and evaluated.},

	abstract = {The new hybrid-BCI-DNI atlas is a high-resolution MPRAGE, single-subject atlas, constructed using both anatomical and functional information to guide the parcellation of the cerebral cortex. Anatomical labeling was performed manually on coronal single-slice images guided by sulcal and gyral landmarks to generate the original (non-hybrid) BCI-DNI atlas. Functional sub-parcellations of the gyral ROIs were then generated from 40 minimally preprocessed resting fMRI datasets from the HCP database. Gyral ROIs were transferred from the BCI-DNI atlas to the 40 subjects using the HCP grayordinate space as a reference. For each subject, each gyral ROI was subdivided using the fMRI data by applying spectral clustering to a similarity matrix computed from the fMRI time-series correlations between each vertex pair. The sub-parcellations were then transferred back to the original cortical mesh to create the subparcellated hBCI-DNI atlas with a total of 67 cortical regions per hemisphere. To assess the stability of the gyral subdivisons, a separate set of 60 HCP datasets were processed as follows: 1) coregistration of the structural scans to the hBCI-DNI atlas; 2) coregistration of the anatomical BCI-DNI atlas without functional subdivisions, followed by sub-parcellation of each subject’s resting fMRI data as described above. We then computed consistency between the anatomically-driven delineation of each gyral subdivision and that obtained per subject using individual fMRI data. The gyral sub-parcellations generated by atlas-based registration show variable but generally good overlap of the confidence intervals with the resting fMRI-based subdivisions. These consistency measures will provide a quantitative measure of reliability of each subdivision to users of the atlas.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause widespread and prolonged brain degeneration. TBI can affect cognitive function and brain integrity for many years after injury, often with lasting effects in children, whose brains are still immature. Although TBI varies in how it affects different individuals, image analysis methods such as tensor-based morphometry (TBM) can reveal common areas of brain atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), secondary effects of the initial injury, which will differ between subjects. Here we studied 36 pediatric moderate to severe TBI (msTBI) participants in the post-acute phase (1-6 months post-injury) and 18 msTBI participants who returned for their chronic assessment, along with well-matched controls at both time-points. Participants completed a battery of cognitive tests that we used to create a global cognitive performance score. Using TBM, we created three-dimensional (3D) maps of individual and group differences in regional brain volumes. At both the post-acute and chronic time-points, the greatest group differences were expansion of the lateral ventricles and reduction of the lingual gyrus in the TBI group. We found a number of smaller clusters of volume reduction in the cingulate gyrus, thalamus, and fusiform gyrus, and throughout the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Additionally, we found extensive associations between our cognitive performance measure and regional brain volume. Our results indicate a pattern of atrophy still detectable 1-year post-injury, which may partially underlie the cognitive deficits frequently found in TBI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of conventional MR imaging in predicting glioma grade are not high. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) measurements derived from perfusion MR imaging and metabolite ratios from proton MR spectroscopy are useful in predicting glioma grade. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of perfusion MR imaging and MR spectroscopy compared with conventional MR imaging in grading primary gliomas.
METHODS: One hundred sixty patients with a primary cerebral glioma underwent conventional MR imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced T2*-weighted perfusion MR imaging, and proton MR spectroscopy. Gliomas were graded as low or high based on conventional MR imaging findings. The rCBV measurements were obtained from regions of maximum perfusion. Metabolite ratios (choline [Cho]/creatine [Cr], Cho/N-acetylaspartate [NAA], and NAA/Cr) were measured at a TE of 144 ms. Tumor grade determined with the three methods was then compared with that from histopathologic grading. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to determine optimum thresholds for tumor grading. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for identifying high-grade gliomas were also calculated.
RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for determining a high-grade glioma with conventional MR imaging were 72.5\%, 65.0\%, 86.1\%, and 44.1\%, respectively. Statistical analysis demonstrated a threshold value of 1.75 for rCBV to provide sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 95.0\%, 57.5\%, 87.0\%, and 79.3\%, respectively. Threshold values of 1.08 and 1.56 for Cho/Cr and 0.75 and 1.60 for Cho/NAA provided the minimum C2 and C1 errors, respectively, for determining a high-grade glioma. The combination of rCBV, Cho/Cr, and Cho/NAA resulted in sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 93.3\%, 60.0\%, 87.5\%, and 75.0\%, respectively. Significant differences were noted in the rCBV and Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, and NAA/Cr ratios between low- and high-grade gliomas (P {\textless} .0001, .0121, .001, and .0038, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The rCBV measurements and metabolite ratios both individually and in combination can increase the sensitivity and PPV when compared with conventional MR imaging alone in determining glioma grade. The rCBV measurements had the most superior diagnostic performance (either with or without metabolite ratios) in predicting glioma grade. Threshold values can be used in a clinical setting to evaluate tumors preoperatively for histologic grade and provide a means for guiding treatment and predicting postoperative patient outcome.},

Echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences, which are frequently used for acquisition of diffusion images, are sensitive to inhomogeneities in the primary magnetic (B0) field that cause localized distortions in the reconstructed images. We describe and evaluate a new method for correction of susceptibility-induced distortion in diffusion images in the absence of an accurate B0 fieldmap. In our method, the distortion field is estimated using a constrained non-rigid registration between an undistorted T1-weighted anatomical image and one of the distorted EPI images from diffusion acquisition. Our registration framework is based on a new approach, INVERSION (Inverse contrast Normalization for VERy Simple registratION), which exploits the inverted contrast relationship between T1- and T2-weighted brain images to define a simple and robust similarity measure. We also describe how INVERSION can be used for rigid alignment of diffusion images and T1-weighted anatomical images. Our approach is evaluated with multiple in vivo datasets acquired with different acquisition parameters. Compared to other methods, INVERSION shows robust and consistent performance in rigid registration and shows improved alignment of diffusion and anatomical images relative to normalized mutual information for non-rigid distortion correction.},

Intensity-driven registration typically results in some degree of misalignment of cortical and gyral folds. Increased statistical power in group studies may be achieved through improved alignment of cortical areas by using sulcal landmarks. In this paper we describe a new volumetric registration method in which cortical surfaces and sulcal landmarks are accurately aligned. We first compute a one-to-one map between the two cortical surfaces constrained by a set of user identified sulcal curves. We then extrapolate this mapping from the cortical surface to the entire brain volume using a harmonic mapping procedure. Finally, this volumetric mapping is refined using an intensity driven linear elastic registration. The resulting maps retain the one-to-one correspondence between cortical surfaces while also aligning volumetric features via the intensity-driven registration. We evaluate performance of this method in comparison to other volumetric registration methods.},

The atlas for individual wrist bones was selected based on the shortest ℓ2 distance to the ensemble of wrist bones from a database of a healthy population of subjects. The selected atlas was then warped to the corresponding bones of individuals in the population using a non-linear registration method based on regularized ℓ2 distance minimization. The displacement field thus calculated showed local differences in bone shape that then were used for the analysis of group differences. Our results indicate that RBM has potential to provide a standardized approach to shape analysis of bones of the human wrist. We demonstrate the performance of RBM for examining group differences in wrist bone shapes based on sex and between those of the right and left wrists in healthy individuals.

	abstract = {Objective: The long-term efficacy and safety of responsive direct neurostimulation was assessed in adults with medically refractory partial onset seizures.
Methods: All participants were treated with a cranially implanted responsive neurostimulator that delivers stimulation to 1 or 2 seizure foci via chronically implanted electrodes when specific electrocorticographic patterns are detected (RNS System). Participants had completed a 2-year primarily open-label safety study (n = 65) or a 2-year randomized blinded controlled safety and efficacy study (n = 191); 230 participants transitioned into an ongoing 7-year study to assess safety and efficacy.
Results: The average participant was 34 (±11.4) years old with epilepsy for 19.6 (±11.4) years. The median preimplant frequency of disabling partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures was 10.2 seizures a month. The median percent seizure reduction in the randomized blinded controlled trial was 44\% at 1 year and 53\% at 2 years (p {\textless} 0.0001, generalized estimating equation) and ranged from 48\% to 66\% over postimplant years 3 through 6 in the long-term study. Improvements in quality of life were maintained (p {\textless} 0.05). The most common serious device-related adverse events over the mean 5.4 years of follow-up were implant site infection (9.0\%) involving soft tissue and neurostimulator explantation (4.7\%).
Conclusions: The RNS System is the first direct brain responsive neurostimulator. Acute and sustained efficacy and safety were demonstrated in adults with medically refractory partial onset seizures arising from 1 or 2 foci over a mean follow-up of 5.4 years. This experience supports the RNS System as a treatment option for refractory partial seizures.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that for adults with medically refractory partial onset seizures, responsive direct cortical stimulation reduces seizures and improves quality of life over a mean follow-up of 5.4 years.},

To demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of responsive stimulation at the seizure focus as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the frequency of seizures in adults with medically intractable partial onset seizures arising from one or two seizure foci.


Methods

Randomized multicenter double-blinded controlled trial of responsive focal cortical stimulation (RNS System). Subjects with medically intractable partial onset seizures from one or two foci were implanted, and 1 month postimplant were randomized 1:1 to active or sham stimulation. After the fifth postimplant month, all subjects received responsive stimulation in an open label period (OLP) to complete 2 years of postimplant follow-up.


Results

All 191 subjects were randomized. The percent change in seizures at the end of the blinded period was −37.9\% in the active and −17.3\% in the sham stimulation group (p = 0.012, Generalized Estimating Equations). The median percent reduction in seizures in the OLP was 44\% at 1 year and 53\% at 2 years, which represents a progressive and significant improvement with time (p {\textless} 0.0001). The serious adverse event rate was not different between subjects receiving active and sham stimulation. Adverse events were consistent with the known risks of an implanted medical device, seizures, and of other epilepsy treatments. There were no adverse effects on neuropsychological function or mood.


Significance

Responsive stimulation to the seizure focus reduced the frequency of partial-onset seizures acutely, showed improving seizure reduction over time, was well tolerated, and was acceptably safe. The RNS System provides an additional treatment option for patients with medically intractable partial-onset seizures.},

	abstract = {Directed graph representations of brain networks are increasingly being used to indicate the direction and level of influence among brain regions. Most of the existing techniques for directed graph representations are based on time series analysis and the concept of causality, and use time lag information in the brain signals. These time lag-based techniques can be inadequate for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal analysis due to the limited time resolution of fMRI as well as the low frequency hemodynamic response. The aim of this paper is to present a novel measure of necessity that uses asymmetry in the joint distribution of brain activations to infer the direction and level of interaction among brain regions. We present a mathematical formula for computing necessity and extend this measure to partial necessity, which can potentially distinguish between direct and indirect interactions. These measures do not depend on time lag for directed modeling of brain interactions and therefore are more suitable for fMRI signal analysis. The necessity measures were used to analyze resting state fMRI data to determine the presence of hierarchy and asymmetry of brain interactions during resting state. We performed ROI-wise analysis using the proposed necessity measures to study the default mode network. The empirical joint distribution of the fMRI signals was determined using kernel density estimation, and was used for computation of the necessity and partial necessity measures. The significance of these measures was determined using a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the posterior cingulate cortex plays a central role in the default mode network.},

The resulting changes are commonly analyzed using tensor-based morphometry to make inferences about anatomical differences, often based on the Jacobian map, which estimates local tissue gain or loss. Here, we provide rigorous mathematical analyses of the Jacobian maps, and use them to motivate a new numerical method to construct unbiased nonlinear image registration. First, we argue that logarithmic transformation is crucial for analyzing Jacobian values representing morphometric differences. We then examine the statistical distributions of log-Jacobian maps by defining the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance on material density functions arising in continuum-mechanical models. With this framework, unbiased image registration can be constructed by quantifying the symmetric KL-distance between the identity map and the resulting deformation. Implementation details, addressing the proposed unbiased registration as well as the minimization of symmetric image matching functionals, are then discussed and shown to be applicable to other registration methods, such as inverse consistent registration. In the results section, we test the proposed framework, as well as present an illustrative application mapping detailed 3-D brain changes in sequential magnetic resonance imaging scans of a patient diagnosed with semantic dementia. Using permutation tests, we show that the symmetrization of image registration statistically reduces skewness in the log-Jacobian map.},

The purpose of this study was to review the literature relating to the psychosocial costs associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Methods
Nine online journal databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and PUBMED, were queried for studies between July 2010 and May 2012 pertaining to the economic burden of head injuries. Additional studies were identified through searching bibliographies of related publications and using Google internet search engine.

Results
One hundred and eight potentially relevant abstracts were identified from the journal databases. Ten papers were chosen for discussion in this review. All but two of the chosen papers were US studies. The studies included a cost-benefit analysis of the implementation of treatment guidelines from the US brain trauma foundation and a cost-effectiveness analysis of post-acute traumatic brain injury rehabilitation.

Conclusion
Very little research has been published on the economic burden that mild and moderate traumatic brain injury patients pose to their families, careers, and society as a whole. Further research is needed to estimate the economic burden of these patients on healthcare providers and social services and how this can impact current health policies and practices.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant problem in older adults. In persons aged 65 and older, TBI is responsible for more than 80,000 emergency department visits each year; three-quarters of these visits result in hospitalization as a result of the injury. Adults aged 75 and older have the highest rates of TBI-related hospitalization and death. Falls are the leading cause of TBI for older adults (51\%), and motor vehicle traffic crashes are second (9\%). Older age is known to negatively influence outcome after TBI. Although geriatric and neurotrauma investigators have identified the prognostic significance of preadmission functional ability, comorbidities, sex, and other factors such as cerebral perfusion pressure on recovery after illness or injury, these variables remain understudied in older adults with TBI. In the absence of good clinical data, predicting outcomes and providing care in the older adult population with TBI remains problematic. To address this significant public health issue, a refocusing of research efforts on this population is justified to prevent TBI in the older adult and to discern unique care requirements to facilitate best patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Penetrating brain injury (PBI) has the highest risk for inducing posttraumatic epilepsy, and those PBIs with retained foreign materials such as bullet fragments carry the greatest risk. This study examines the potential contribution of copper, a major component of bullets, to the development of epilepsy following PBI.
METHODS: Anesthetized adult male rats received a penetrating injury from the dorsal cortex to the ventral hippocampus from a high speed small bit drill. In one group of animals, copper wire was inserted into the lesion. Control animals had only the lesion or the lesion plus stainless steel wire (biologically inert foreign body). From 6 to up to 11 months following the injury the rats were monitored intermittently for the development of epilepsy with video-electroencephalography (EEG). A separate set of animals was examined for possible acute seizures in the week following the injury.
RESULTS: Twenty-two of the 23 animals with copper wire developed chronic epilepsy, compared to three of the 20 control rats (lesion and lesion with stainless steel). Copper was associated with more extensive injury. The control rats with epilepsy had larger lesions. In the acute injury group, there was no difference in the incidence of seizures (83\% lesion plus stainless steel, 70\% lesion plus copper).
SIGNIFICANCE: Copper increases the risk for epilepsy and may increase damage over time, but there were no differences between the groups in the incidence of acute postinjury seizures. Lesion size may contribute to epilepsy development in lesion-only animals. Copper may be an independent risk factor for the development of epilepsy and possible secondary injury, but lesion size also contributes to the development of epilepsy. The consequences of prolonged exposure of the brain to copper observed in these animals may have clinical implications that require further evaluation.},

	abstract = {Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is often occult to conventional imaging techniques. However, there is growing evidence that mTBI patients who lack evidence of structural intracranial injury may develop post-concussive syndrome (PCS). We investigated longitudinal alterations in resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) in brain networks in a population of 28 patients compared to 28 matched control participants. Rs-FC and cerebral blood flow (CBF) within the nodes of the Default Mode Network (DMN) and Task Positive Network (TPN) were assessed at three time points including acute, sub-acute, and chronic stages following mTBI. Participants received the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) to assess cognitive performance. Main findings indicate that despite normalized cognitive performance, chronic mTBI patients demonstrate increased rs-FC between the DMN and regions associated with the salience network (SN) and TPN compared to the control populations, as well as reduced strength of rs-FC within the DMN at the acute stage of injury. In addition, chronic mTBI patients demonstrate an imbalance in the ratio of CBF between nodes of the DMN and TPN. Furthermore, preliminary exploratory analysis suggests that compared to those without chronic PCS, patients with chronic PCS reveal an imbalance in the ratio of CBF between the DMN nodes and TPN nodes across multiple stages of recovery. Findings suggest that the altered network perfusion with the associated changes in rs-FC may be a possible predictor of which mTBI patients will develop chronic PCS.},

	abstract = {Adaptive brain function is characterized by dynamic interactions within and between neuronal circuits, often occurring at the time scale of milliseconds. These complex interactions between adjacent and noncontiguous brain areas depend on a functional architecture that is maintained even in the absence of input. Functional MRI studies carried out during rest (R-fMRI) suggest that this architecture is represented in low-frequency ({\textless}0.1 Hz) spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal that are correlated within spatially distributed networks of brain areas. These networks, collectively referred to as the brain's intrinsic functional architecture, exhibit a remarkable correspondence with patterns of task-evoked coactivation as well as maps of anatomical connectivity. Despite this striking correspondence, there is no direct evidence that this intrinsic architecture forms the scaffold that gives rise to faster processes relevant to information processing and seizure spread. Here, we demonstrate that the spatial distribution and magnitude of temporally correlated low-frequency fluctuations observed with R-fMRI during rest predict the pattern and magnitude of corticocortical evoked potentials elicited within 500 ms after single-pulse electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex with intracranial electrodes. Across individuals, this relationship was found to be independent of the specific regions and functional systems probed. Our findings bridge the immense divide between the temporal resolutions of these distinct measures of brain function and provide strong support for the idea that the low-frequency signal fluctuations observed with R-fMRI maintain and update the intrinsic architecture underlying the brain's repertoire of functional responses.},

	abstract = {Node definition, or delineating how the brain is parcellated into individual functionally-related regions, is the first step to accurately map the human connectome. As a result, parcellation of the human brain has drawn considerable attention in the field of neuroscience. The thalamus is known as a relay in the human brain, with its nuclei sending fibers to cortical and subcortical regions. Functional MRI techniques offer a way to parcellate the thalamus in vivo based on its connectivity properties. However, the parcellations from previous studies show that both the number and the distribution of thalamic subdivisions vary with different cortical segmentation methods. Here, we used an unsupervised clustering method that does not rely on a priori information of the cortical segmentation to parcellate the thalamus. Instead, this approach is based on the intrinsic resting-state functional connectivity profiles of the thalamus with the whole brain. A series of cluster solutions were obtained, and an optimal solution was determined. Furthermore, the validity of our parcellation was investigated through: 1) identifying specific resting-state connectivity patterns of thalamic parcels with different brain networks; and 2) investigating the task activation and psychophysiological interactions of specific thalamic clusters during 8-Hz flashing checkerboard stimulation with simultaneous finger tapping. Together, the current study provides a reliable parcellation of the thalamus and enhances our understating of thalamic. Furthermore, the current study provides a framework for parcellation that could be potentially extended to other subcortical and cortical regions.},

In contrast to the widely used general linear model (GLM) that requires the user to parameterize the data (e.g. the brain's response to stimuli), ICA, by relying upon a general assumption of independence, allows the user to be agnostic regarding the exact form of the response. In addition, ICA is intrinsically a multivariate approach, and hence each component provides a grouping of brain activity into regions that share the same response pattern thus providing a natural measure of functional connectivity. There are a wide variety of ICA approaches that have been proposed, in this paper we focus upon two distinct methods. The first part of this paper reviews the use of ICA for making group inferences from fMRI data. We provide an overview of current approaches for utilizing ICA to make group inferences with a focus upon the group ICA approach implemented in the GIFT software. In the next part of this paper, we provide an overview of the use of ICA to combine or fuse multimodal data. ICA has proven particularly useful for data fusion of multiple tasks or data modalities such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data or event-related potentials. As demonstrated by a number of examples in this paper, ICA is a powerful and versatile data-driven approach for studying the brain.},

The necessary matrix solutions are obtained in reasonable time using a multigrid method. A constant Eulerian velocity framework is used, which allows a rapid scaling and squaring method to be used in the computations. DARTEL has been applied to intersubject registration of 471 whole brain images, and the resulting deformations were evaluated in terms of how well they encode the shape information necessary to separate male and female subjects and to predict the ages of the subjects.},

The consequences of local or global enhancement of functional connectivity remain uncertain and this is particularly true for the overall metabolic cost of the network. We examine the hyperconnectivity hypothesis in a sample of 14 individuals with TBI with data collected at approximately 3, 6, and 12 months following moderate and severe TBI. As anticipated, individuals with TBI showed increased network strength and cost early after injury, but by one-year post injury hyperconnectivity was more circumscribed to frontal DMN and temporal-parietal attentional control regions. Cost in these subregions was a significant predictor of cognitive performance. Cost-efficiency analysis in the Power 264 data parcellation suggested that at 6 months post injury the network requires higher cost connections to achieve high efficiency as compared to the network 12 months post injury. These results demonstrate that networks self-organize to re-establish connectivity while balancing cost-efficiency trade-offs.},

	abstract = {The inquisitiveness about what happens in the brain has been there since the beginning of humankind. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is a prominent tool which helps in the non-invasive examination, localisation as well as lateralisation of brain functions such as language, memory, etc. In recent years, there is an apparent shift in the focus of neuroscience research to studies dealing with a brain at 'resting state'. Here the spotlight is on the intrinsic activity within the brain, in the absence of any sensory or cognitive stimulus. The analyses of functional brain connectivity in the state of rest have revealed different resting state networks, which depict specific functions and varied spatial topology. However, different statistical methods have been introduced to study resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity, yet producing consistent results. In this article, we introduce the concept of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging in detail, then discuss three most widely used methods for analysis, describe a few of the resting state networks featuring the brain regions, associated cognitive functions and clinical applications of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. This review aims to highlight the utility and importance of studying resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity, underlining its complementary nature to the task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

Graph theory represents a powerful quantitative framework for investigation of brain networks. Here we investigate whether functional network changes are present in extratemporal focal epilepsy., Task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 15 subjects with extratemporal epilepsy and 26 age and gender matched healthy controls were used for analysis. Local network properties were calculated using local efficiency, clustering coefficient and modularity metrics. Global network properties were assessed with global efficiency and betweenness centrality metrics. Cost-efficiency of the networks at both local and global levels was evaluated by estimating the physical distance between functionally connected nodes, in addition to the overall numbers of connections in the network., Clustering coefficient, local efficiency and modularity were significantly higher in individuals with focal epilepsy than healthy control subjects, while global efficiency and betweenness centrality were not significantly different between the two groups. Local network properties were also highly efficient, at low cost, in focal epilepsy subjects compared to healthy controls., Our results show that functional networks in focal epilepsy are altered in a way that the nodes of the network are more isolated. We postulate that network regularity, or segregation of the nodes of the networks, may be an adaptation that inhibits the conversion of the interictal state to seizures. It remains possible that this may be part of the epileptogenic process or an effect of medications.,

	abstract = {Posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) is defined as a recurrent seizure disorder due to injury to the brain following traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI accounts for 10–20\% of symptomatic epilepsy in the general population and 5\% of all epilepsy. Prevention or suppression of the development of PTE is a major unmet challenge in medicine. During the past 5 years, an increasing number of laboratories have investigated the development of epilepsy in models of TBI. These data show that epileptogenesis or increased seizure susceptibility develop in weight-drop, closed skull, controlled cortical impact (CCI), and fluid-percussion (FP) models of TBI. Spontaneous electrographic seizures have been recorded in FP and CCI models. However, identification of critical molecular, cellular, and network characteristics predicting epileptogenesis in individual animals, as well as in humans, with TBI remains a challenge. As epileptogenesis occurs only in a subpopulation of subjects, biomarkers pinpointing individuals at risk for epileptogenesis are urgently needed. As some treatments have shown favorable effects by preventing the development of increased post-TBI seizure susceptibility, their effects on the development of spontaneous seizures, as well as on recovery processes occurring in parallel with epileptogenesis, require further studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical assessment of cerebral concussion relies on the presence and duration of post concussive symptoms (PCS). Given that these PCS are subjective reports and not always specific to concussion, their usefulness remains to be validated.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of self-reported PCS by means of cognitive tests and functional MRI (fMRI).
METHOD: 28 male athletes with and without concussion were grouped according to their PCS score. They were then administered a computerised cognitive test battery and submitted to an fMRI session where cerebral activations associated with verbal and non-verbal working memory tasks were analysed.
RESULTS: Behaviourally, response accuracy and speed on the cognitive test battery were comparable for the control and low PCS group. The moderate PCS group showed significantly slower response times than the control group on the matching (p{\textless}0.05) and one-back tasks (p{\textless}0.05). The functional MRI study showed reduced task related activation patterns in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for both low and moderate PCS groups. Activation peaks outside the regions of interest, not seen in the control group, were also noted for both PCS groups. Regression analyses indicated an inverse relationship between PCS scores and performances on several CogSport subtests. Severity of PCS also predicted fMRI blood oxygen level dependent signal changes in cerebral prefrontal regions.
CONCLUSION: Self-reported PCS is associated with an ongoing cerebral haemodynamic abnormality as well as with mild cognitive impairment. These results support the use of the PCS scale in the assessment of cerebral concussion and in monitoring recovery.},

	abstract = {Summary
Over 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy. In nearly 30\% of these cases, epilepsy remains unsatisfactorily controlled despite the availability of over 20 antiepileptic drugs. Moreover, no treatments exist to prevent the development of epilepsy in those at risk, despite an increasing understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular pathways. One of the major factors that have impeded rapid progress in these areas is the complex and multifactorial nature of epilepsy, and its heterogeneity. Therefore, the vision of developing targeted treatments for epilepsy relies upon the development of biomarkers that allow individually tailored treatment. Biomarkers for epilepsy typically fall into two broad categories: diagnostic biomarkers, which provide information on the clinical status of, and potentially the sensitivity to, specific treatments, and prognostic biomarkers, which allow prediction of future clinical features, such as the speed of progression, severity of epilepsy, development of comorbidities, or prediction of remission or cure. Prognostic biomarkers are of particular importance because they could be used to identify which patients will develop epilepsy and which might benefit from preventive treatments. Biomarker research faces several challenges; however, biomarkers could substantially improve the management of people with epilepsy and could lead to prevention in the right person at the right time, rather than just symptomatic treatment.},

METHODS: Children with symptomatic TLE (n=14: 9 with mesial TLE due to hippocampal atrophy and 5 with TLE due to neocortical lesions), healthy children (n=14), and 9 adults with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) were compared using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The children underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological battery.
RESULTS: Children with MTLE with unilateral hippocampal atrophy (n=9) exhibited a significant reduction in gray matter in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the seizure origin and significant atrophy in the ipsilateral cingulate gyrus and contralateral middle frontal lobe. Children with TLE (n=14) exhibited a significant reduction in the gray matter of the ipsilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. There was a correlation between gray matter volume in children with TLE and scores on several neuropsychological tests. Atrophy in pediatric patients with MTLE was less extensive than that in adults, and involved the hippocampi and the frontal cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: Similar to adult MTLE, pediatric MTLE is associated with hippocampal and extrahippocampal cell loss. However, children display less intense quantifiable gray matter atrophy, which affects predominantly frontal lobe areas. There was a significant association between volume of gray matter in medial temporal and frontal regions and scores on neuropsychological tests. In childhood, TLE and the concomitant cognitive/behavior disturbances are the result of a damaged neural network.},

METHODS: Twenty-eight children with cryptogenic epilepsy, all of whom had CPS, and gender-matched normal children, all aged 6-16 years, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5T. Tissue was segmented, and total brain volume and amygdala volumes obtained from manual tracings were computed.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in amygdala volume between the CPS and normal groups. Within the CPS group, the children with an affective/anxiety disorder had significantly larger left amygdala volumes, as well as greater amygdala asymmetry, compared with those with no psychopathology. Exploring the association between seizure variables and amygdala volume yielded no significant predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CPS, left amygdala involvement may reflect effects of the neuropathology underlying comorbid affective or anxiety disorders on amygdala development rather than effects of ongoing seizures.},

METHODS: Using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we compared the hippocampal volumes of 19 medically treated children with CPS, aged 6-14 years, to 21 age and gender matched normal children.
RESULTS: The children with CPS had significantly smaller total hippocampal volumes than the normal children. This finding was accounted for primarily by significantly smaller anterior hippocampal volumes. Within the CPS group, smaller total and posterior hippocampus volumes were significantly associated with longer duration of illness. Anterior hippocampal volumes, however, were unrelated to seizure variables.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings imply impaired development of the hippocampus, particularly the anterior hippocampus, and a differential effect of the underlying illness and on-going seizures on hippocampal development in medically controlled pediatric CPS.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The role of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluation of childhood epilepsy remains poorly defined, with minimal published data. Previous work from our center questioned the specificity of hippocampal asymmetry (HA) in an outpatient group whose epilepsy was defined by using clinical and interictal data only. By using childhood volunteer controls and defining epilepsy syndromes using video-EEG monitoring, we readdressed the utility of HA in differentiating mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) from other partial and generalized epileptic syndromes in children.
METHODS: Seventy children were enrolled; entry criteria were age younger than 18 years with predominant seizure type recorded on video-EEG telemetry with volumetric MRI in all cases. Thirty healthy child volunteers had volumetric MRI. Epilepsy syndrome classification was according to ILAE.
RESULTS: Control data revealed symmetric hippocampi, mean smaller/larger ratio of 0.96 (0.95-0.97, 95\% CI) with no gender or right/left predominance. Overall 23\% of patients had significant HA. Mean hippocampal ratio for MTLE was 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.70-0.86), significantly lower than controls and from all other epilepsy syndromes. HA was highly specific (85\%) to the syndrome of MTLE. Other potential epileptogenic lesions were found in 27 (39\%) patients, lowest yield in frontal and mesial temporal syndromes. Dual pathology was present in 10\% of patients. There was no significant association between HA and risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that HA in children with a well-defined epilepsy syndrome is highly sensitive and specific for MTLE. Whether this will correlate with surgical outcome, as in adults, is the subject of ongoing study.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We examined the factors related to brain volume reduction in a pediatric sample of patients that included those with nonintractable epilepsy.
METHODS: Entry criteria were children less than 18 years old with epilepsy referred for MRI, including a whole brain volumetric sequence. The sample size was 231. Risk factors were ascertained from interviews and reviews of medical records. Factors included age of onset, seizure years, family history, status epilepticus, intellectual disability, and febrile convulsions. MRI data were obtained for 44 normal childhood control subjects.
RESULTS: Cerebral and cerebellar volumes were significantly associated with age, gender, moderate-to-severe intellectual disability (p {\textless} 0.001), seizure years, and status epilepticus (p {\textless} 0.03). Compared with controls, the brain volume of all patients was reduced by 10\% (p {\textless} 0.001). Hippocampal volume was significantly associated with total brain volume, age (p {\textless} 0.001), focal cerebral ischemic injury, and complex febrile convulsions (p {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant brain volume reduction is present in children with epilepsy. A component of this reduction is due to acquired insults. The reduction is seen even in children with infrequent seizures over a brief time, suggesting an innate structural abnormality. When evaluating possible etiologic factors in the development of hippocampal volume reduction, one must control for total brain volume. We have confirmed the association of complex febrile convulsions with unilateral hippocampal volume reduction.},

Hippocampal volume loss is maximal in the syndrome of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We aimed (a) to validate this methodology in a pediatric outpatient epilepsy population (b) to determine the relationship of hippocampal asymmetry (HA) to epileptic syndromes and risk factors.
METHODS: Two neurologists classified the epileptic syndrome in 79 pediatric outpatients, according to the International Classification of Epilepsies and Epileptic Syndromes (ILAE). Hippocampal volumetrics were performed in all patients. HA was defined according to adult control values.
RESULTS: Inter-rater variability on measurement of HA was very small (Correlation of test retest of 0.97 on 17 children {\textless}3 years old). The rate of HA was 44/79 (57\%). In 21 patients, (27\%) potentially epileptogenic lesions (other than HA) were identified (cerebral dysgenesis n = 11). HA was present in 9/15 (60\%) of temporal lobe epilepsy and in 15/28 (54\%) extratemporal onset epilepsy and 5/11 (46\%) of generalized symptomatic epilepsy. Analysis confined to {\textless}13 years also showed HA was not specific for epileptic syndrome. There was no significant association of febrile convulsions (13\%) with HA or temporal lobe epilepsy.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high incidence of HA in childhood epilepsy. HA was not confined to clinically defined temporal lobe epilepsy. The poor correlation of epileptic syndrome to quantitative MRI findings may be due to the inadequacies of epilepsy classification in the younger child, with the clinical semiology providing misleading localizing information.

Controlled prospective investigations initiated at or near epilepsy onset would best characterize the nature, timing and course of neuroimaging abnormalities in paediatric epilepsy. In this study, we report the results of a deformation-based morphometry technique to examine baseline and 2-year prospective neurodevelopmental brain changes in children with new and recent onset localization-related epilepsies (n = 24) and idiopathic generalized epilepsies (n = 20) compared to healthy controls (n = 36). Children with epilepsy demonstrated differences from controls in baseline grey and white matter volumes suggesting antecedent anomalies in brain development, as well as abnormal patterns of prospective brain development that involved not only slowed white matter expansion, but also abnormalities of cortical grey matter development involving both greater and lesser volume changes compared to controls. Furthermore, abnormal neurodevelopmental changes extended outside the cortex affecting several subcortical structures including thalamus, cerebellum, brainstem and pons. Finally, there were significant differences between the epilepsy syndromes (localization-related epilepsies and idiopathic generalized epilepsies) with the idiopathic generalized epilepsies group showing a more disrupted pattern of brain structure both at baseline and over the 2-year interval.},

Because most previous studies examined moderate/severe TBI, the extensiveness of functional connectivity abnormalities and their relationship to postconcussive complaints or white matter microstructural damage are unclear in mild TBI. This study characterized widespread injury effects on multiple integrated neural networks typically observed during a task-unconstrained "resting state" in mild TBI patients. Whole brain functional connectivity for twelve separate networks was identified using independent component analysis (ICA) of fMRI data collected from thirty mild TBI patients mostly free of macroscopic intracerebral injury and thirty demographically-matched healthy control participants. Voxelwise group comparisons found abnormal mild TBI functional connectivity in every brain network identified by ICA, including visual processing, motor, limbic, and numerous circuits believed to underlie executive cognition. Abnormalities not only included functional connectivity deficits, but also enhancements possibly reflecting compensatory neural processes. Postconcussive symptom severity was linked to abnormal regional connectivity within nearly every brain network identified, particularly anterior cingulate. A recently developed multivariate technique that identifies links between whole brain profiles of functional and anatomical connectivity identified several novel mild TBI abnormalities, and represents a potentially important new tool in the study of the complex neurobiological sequelae of TBI.},

Importantly, many TBI victims develop epilepsy months or years following the initial injury, making this patient population a prime target for the development of antiepileptogenesis therapies. However, progress in this area of clinical research is hindered by the lack of reliable and valid biomarkers.

While seizure prophylaxis can prevent early onset seizures, no available treatments effectively prevent late-onset seizure. Little is known about the progression of neural injury over time and how this injury progression contributes to late onset seizure development. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the epidemiology and risk factors for post-traumatic epilepsy and the current pharmacologic agents used for treatment. We highlight limitations with the current approach and offer suggestions for remedying the knowledge gap. Critical to this pursuit is the design of pre-clinical models to investigate important mechanistic factors responsible for post-traumatic epilepsy development. We discuss what the current models have provided in terms of understanding acute injury and what is needed to advance understanding regarding late onset seizure. New model designs will be used to investigate novel pathways linking acute injury to chronic changes within the brain. Important components of this transition are likely mediated by toll-like receptors, neuroinflammation, and tauopathy. In the final section, we highlight current experimental therapies that may prove promising in preventing and treating post-traumatic epilepsy. By increasing understanding about post-traumatic epilepsy and injury expansion over time, it will be possible to design better treatments with specific molecular targets to prevent late-onset seizure occurrence following traumatic brain injury.},

After a variable latency period, late unprovoked seizures and epilepsy occur. The latent period may offer a therapeutic window for the prevention of epileptogenesis and the development of unprovoked seizures and epilepsy. Administration of anticonvulsant drugs following acute brain insults has thus far failed to prevent late epilepsy. Proper choice of disease models and target populations will aid in the development of putative antiepileptogenic agents.

        Objectives: To determine the prevalence of TBI alone and TBI with other conditions and the average cost of medical care for veterans with these diagnoses.
        Methods: Observational study using national inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy data from Veterans Health Administration (VHA) datasets. Costs are estimated from utilization related to care within the VHA system. Participants were all OEF/OIF VHA users in 2009.
        Results: Among 327,388 OEF/OIF veterans using VHA services in 2009, 6.7\% were diagnosed with TBI. Among those with TBI diagnoses, 89\% were diagnosed with a psychiatric diagnosis [the most frequent being posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at 73\%], and 70\% had a diagnosis of head, back, or neck pain. The rate of comorbid PTSD and pain among those with and without TBI was 54\% and 11\%, respectively. The median annual cost per patient was nearly 4-times higher for TBI-diagnosed veterans as compared with those without TBI (\$5831 vs. \$1547). Within the TBI group, cost increased as diagnostic complexity increased, such that those with TBI, pain, and PTSD demonstrated the highest median cost per patient (\$7974).
        Conclusions: The vast majority of VHA patients diagnosed with TBI also have a diagnosed mental disorder and more than half have both PTSD and pain. Patients with these comorbidities incur substantial medical costs and represent a target population for future research aimed at improving health care efficiency.},

TBI was induced by lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI) in adult rats. Quantitative T2, T1ρ, and diffusion were assessed with MRI at 9 days, 23 days, or 2 months post-TBI in the perilesional cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus. Seizure susceptibility was assessed at 12 months after TBI using the pentylenetetrazol seizure-susceptibility test. At 9 and 23 days post-TBI, a change in T1ρ of the perilesional cortex showed the greatest predictive value for increased seizure susceptibility at 12 months post-TBI [area under the curve (AUC), 0.929 and 0.952, respectively; p{\textless}0.01]. At 2 months post-TBI, Dav in the thalamus was the best of the biomarkers analyzed (AUC, 0.988; p{\textless}0.05). The highest predictive value of all biomarkers was achieved by combining the measurement of Dav in the perilesional cortex and the thalamus at 2 months post-TBI (AUC, 1.000; p{\textless}0.01). Our results provide proof-of-concept evidence that clinically relevant MRI biomarkers predict increased seizure susceptibility after experimental TBI.},

The connectome derived from connectivity maps reflects the entire constellation of distributed brain networks. Using these powerful neuroimaging approaches, changes at the microstructural level can be detected through regional and global properties of neuronal networks. Here we will review recent developments in the study of brain network abnormalities in traumatic brain injury, mainly focusing on structural and functional connectivity.

This study was designed to determine the connectome-scale brain network connectivity changes in mTBI at both structural and functional levels. 40 mTBI patients at the acute stage and 50 healthy controls were recruited. A novel approach called Dense Individualized and Common Connectivity-based Cortical Landmarks (DICCCOLs) was applied for connectome-scale analysis of both diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional MRI data. Among 358 networks identified on DICCCOL analysis, 41 networks were identified as structurally discrepant between patient and control groups. The involved major white matter tracts include the corpus callosum, and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi. Functional connectivity analysis identified 60 connectomic signatures that differentiate patients from controls with 93.75\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Analysis of functional domains showed decreased intra-network connectivity within the emotion network and among emotion-cognition interactions, and increased interactions among action-emotion and action-cognition as well as within perception networks. This work suggests that mTBI may result in changes of structural and functional connectivity on a connectome scale at the acute stage.},

RESULTS: Time-locked with the interictal epileptiform discharges, we found significant hemodynamic increases common to all patients near the frontal piriform cortex ipsilateral to the presumed cortical focus. GABA(A) receptor binding in the same area was reduced in patients with more frequent seizures.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of cerebral blood flow and GABAergic changes, irrespective of where interictal or ictal activity occurs in the cortex, suggest that this area of the human primary olfactory cortex may be an attractive new target for epilepsy therapy, including neurosurgery, electrical stimulation, and focal drug delivery.},

METHODS: EEG/fMRI studies in 27 focal epilepsy patients were reviewed with attention given to the extent and location of the IED and the resulting pattern of BOLD signal change. Second order group analysis was used to identify common features.
RESULTS: fMRI results provided novel clinical information for individual patients. We identified a significant common node within the ipsilateral piriform cortex as well as patterns involving distant cortical or subcortical areas.
CONCLUSION: Despite the heterogeneity of IEDs in focal epilepsy, there are important common features underpining IEDs with a highly significant fMRI node in the ipsilateral piriform cortex.
SIGNIFICANCE: There are important common features in the networks involved in IEDs in patients with a heterogeneous range of epileptogenic foci. We confirm that the piriform cortex is a common node underlying IEDs in patients with focal epilepsy and so provides a target for further study and potential therapy.

METHODS: We selected patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE, n = 32), frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE, n = 14), and posterior quadrant epilepsy (PQE, n = 20) from our 3 Tesla EEG-fMRI database. We applied group analysis upon the blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response associated with focal IEDs.
KEY FINDINGS: Patients with TLE and FLE showed activations and deactivations, whereas in PQE only deactivations occurred. In TLE and FLE, the largest activation was in the mid-cingulate gyri bilaterally. In FLE, activations were also found in the ipsilateral frontal operculum, thalamus, and internal capsule, and in the contralateral cerebellum, whereas in TLE, we found additional activations in the ipsilateral mesial and neocortical temporal regions, insula, and cerebellar cortex. All three groups showed deactivations in default mode network regions, the most widespread being in the TLE group, and less in PQE and FLE.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that different epileptic syndromes result in unique and widespread networks related to focal IEDs. Default mode regions are deactivated in response to focal discharges in all three groups with syndrome specific pattern. We conclude that focal IEDs are associated with specific networks of widespread metabolic changes that may cause more substantial disturbance to brain function than might be appreciated from the focal nature of the scalp EEG discharges.},

	abstract = {While closed head injury frequently results in damage to the frontal and temporal lobes, damage to deep cortical structures, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and basal ganglia, has also been reported. Five deep central structures (hippocampus, amygdala, globus pallidus, putamen, and caudate) were examined in 16 children (eight males, eight females; aged 9-16y), imaged 1 to 10 years after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and in 16 individually-matched uninjured children. Analysis revealed significant volume loss in the hippocampus, amydala, and globus pallidus of the TBI group. Investigation of relative volume loss between these structures and against five cortical areas (ventromedial frontal, superomedial frontal, lateral frontal, temporal, and parieto-occipital) revealed the hippocampus to be the most vulnerable structure following TBI (i.e. greatest relative difference between the groups). In a separate analysis excluding children with focal hippocampal abnormalities (e.g. lesions), group differences in hippocampal volume were still evident, suggesting that hippocampal damage may be diffuse rather than focal.},

The objectives of this study were to determine features of anthropometry and cerebral morphometry late after TBI in childhood and to assess whether hippocampal volume is related to severity of initial ictus and changes in white matter at follow-up. Thirty-three patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging 4.9 y after severe TBI that necessitated intensive care; 23 had mechanical ventilation and intracranial pressure monitoring longer than 3 d. Magnetic resonance imaging analyses included volume of brain, hemisphere, ventricles, and hippocampal and perihippocampal regions; spatial distribution of voxel-based morphometry differences in white matter; and eigenvalues of diffusion tensor imaging diffusivity. Patients with longer intensive care ictus had smaller-than-expected occipitofrontal head circumference. Eight of these, identified by voxel-based morphometry, had periventricular white matter loss and smaller-than-expected brain volume for OFC, suggesting "atrophy"; the remainder had expected volume for a smaller OFC, suggesting "growth disturbance." Ninety-three percent of the variation in right hippocampal volume was accounted for by factors related to severity of injury and white matter atrophy. It is concluded that anthropometry and cerebral morphometric measurements late after severe TBI in childhood provides useful outcome data and indicate that, despite adequate growth in stature, effects of TBI on brain growth and hippocampal volume may extend into adulthood.},

In the past, quantitative volumetric analysis of these changes was carried out by manually tracing specific regions of interest. In contrast, voxel based morphometry (VBM) is a fully automated technique that allows examination of the whole brain on a voxel by voxel basis.
OBJECTIVE: To use VBM to evaluate changes in grey matter concentration following traumatic brain injury.
METHODS: Nine patients with a history of traumatic brain injury (ranging from mild to severe) about one year previously were compared with nine age and sex matched healthy volunteers. T1 weighted three dimensional MRI images were acquired and then analysed with statistical parametric mapping software (SPM2). The patients with traumatic brain injury also completed cognitive testing to determine whether regional grey matter concentration correlated with a measure of attention and initial injury severity.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, the brain injured patients had decreased grey matter concentration in multiple brain regions including frontal and temporal cortices, cingulate gyrus, subcortical grey matter, and the cerebellum. Decreased grey matter concentration correlated with lower scores on tests of attention and lower Glasgow coma scale scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Using VBM, regions of decreased grey matter concentration were observed in subjects with traumatic brain injury compared with well matched controls. In the brain injured patients, there was a relation between grey matter concentration and attentional ability.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of long-term disability. Despite the importance of identifying neuropathology in individuals with chronic TBI, methodological challenges posed at the stage of inter-subject image registration have hampered previous voxel-based MRI studies from providing a clear pattern of structural atrophy after TBI. We used a novel symmetric diffeomorphic image normalization method to conduct a tensor-based morphometry (TBM) study of TBI. The key advantage of this method is that it simultaneously estimates an optimal template brain and topology preserving deformations between this template and individual subject brains. Detailed patterns of atrophies are then revealed by statistically contrasting control and subject deformations to the template space. Participants were 29 survivors of TBI and 20 control subjects who were matched in terms of age, gender, education, and ethnicity. Localized volume losses were found most prominently in white matter regions and the subcortical nuclei including the thalamus, the midbrain, the corpus callosum, the mid- and posterior cingulate cortices, and the caudate. Significant voxel-wise volume loss clusters were also detected in the cerebellum and the frontal/temporal neocortices. Volume enlargements were identified largely in ventricular regions. A similar pattern of results was observed in a subgroup analysis where we restricted our analysis to the 17 TBI participants who had no macroscopic focal lesions (total lesion volume {\textgreater}1.5 cm(3)). The current study confirms, extends, and partly challenges previous structural MRI studies in chronic TBI. By demonstrating that a large deformation image registration technique can be successfully combined with TBM to identify TBI-induced diffuse structural changes with greater precision, our approach is expected to increase the sensitivity of future studies examining brain-behavior relationships in the TBI population.},

Patients were scanned at 2 months, 1 year, and 4 years post-injury. High-dimensional warping procedures were used to create change maps of each subject's brain for each of the two intervals. TBI patients experienced volume loss in both cortical areas and white matter regions during the first interval. We also observed continuing volume loss in extensive regions of white matter during the second interval. Neuropsychological correlations indicated that cognitive tasks were associated with subsequent volume loss in task-relevant regions. The extensive volume loss in brain white matter observed well beyond the first year post-injury suggests that the injured brain remains malleable for an extended period, and the neuropsychological relationships suggest that this volume loss may be associated with subtle cognitive improvements.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate longitudinal changes in global and regional brain volume in patients 1 year after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) and to correlate such changes with clinical and neurocognitive metrics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This institutional review board-approved study was HIPAA compliant. Twenty-eight patients with MTBI (with 19 followed up at 1 year) with posttraumatic symptoms after injury and 22 matched control subjects (with 12 followed up at 1 year) were enrolled. Automated segmentation of brain regions to compute regional gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes was performed by using three-dimensional T1-weighted 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging, and results were correlated with clinical metrics. Pearson and Spearman rank correlation coefficients were computed between longitudinal brain volume and neurocognitive scores, as well as clinical metrics, over the course of the follow-up period.
RESULTS: One year after MTBI, there was measurable global brain atrophy, larger than that in control subjects. The anterior cingulate WM bilaterally and the left cingulate gyrus isthmus WM, as well as the right precuneal GM, showed significant decreases in regional volume in patients with MTBI over the 1st year after injury (corrected P {\textless} .05); this was confirmed by means of cross-sectional comparison with data in control subjects (corrected P {\textless} .05). Left and right rostral anterior cingulum WM volume loss correlated with changes in neurocognitive measures of memory (r = 0.65, P = .005) and attention (r = 0.60, P = .01). At 1-year follow-up, WM volume in the left cingulate gyrus isthmus correlated with clinical scores of anxiety (Spearman rank correlation r = -0.68, P = .007) and postconcussive symptoms (Spearman rank correlation r = -0.65, P = .01).
CONCLUSION: These observations demonstrate structural changes to the brain 1 year after injury after a single concussive episode. Regional brain atrophy is not exclusive to moderate and severe traumatic brain injury but may be seen after mild injury. In particular, the anterior part of the cingulum and the cingulate gyrus isthmus, as well as the precuneal GM, may be distinctively vulnerable 1 year after MTBI.},

However, there is little information on the spatial distribution and the clinical significance of this late atrophy. In 24 patients who had sustained severe TBI we acquired 3D T1-weighted MRIs about 8 weeks and 12 months post-injury. For comparison, 14 healthy controls with similar distribution of age, gender and education were scanned with a similar time interval. For each subject, longitudinal atrophy was estimated using SIENA, and atrophy occurring before the first scan time point using SIENAX. Regional distribution of atrophy was evaluated using tensor-based morphometry (TBM). At the first scan time point, brain parenchymal volume was reduced by mean 8.4\% in patients as compared to controls. During the scan interval, patients exhibited continued atrophy with percent brain volume change (\%BVC) ranging between -0.6\% and -9.4\% (mean -4.0\%). \%BVC correlated significantly with injury severity, functional status at both scans, and with 1-year outcome. Moreover, \%BVC improved prediction of long-term functional status over and above what could be predicted using functional status at approximately 8 weeks. In patients as compared to controls, TBM (permutation test, FDR 0.05) revealed a large coherent cluster of significant atrophy in the brain stem and cerebellar peduncles extending bilaterally through the thalamus, internal and external capsules, putamen, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum and corona radiata. This indicates that the long-term atrophy is attributable to consequences of traumatic axonal injury. Despite progressive atrophy, remarkable clinical improvement occurred in most patients.},

The purpose of this short review is to provide an update on the epidemiology of posttraumatic epilepsy, associated risk factors, data from prevention studies, and recent breakthroughs in experimental research.

Recent findings
There is increasing evidence that neuroimaging findings, stratification by neurosurgical procedures performed, and genomic information (e.g. apolipoprotein E and haptoglobin genotypes) may provide useful predictors of the individual risk of developing posttraumatic epilepsy. While antiepileptic drug prophylaxis can be effective in protecting against acute (provoked) seizures occurring within 7 days after injury, no antiepileptic drug treatment has been found to protect against the development of posttraumatic epilepsy and therefore long-term anticonvulsant prophylaxis is not recommended. Glucocorticoid administration early after head injury also has not been found to reduce the risk of posttraumatic epilepsy. At the basic research level, there have been advances in the understanding of pathophysiological changes in posttraumatic excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and the critical period for epileptogenesis after head injury has been better defined. Finally, the development of a novel animal model, which mimicks more closely human posttraumatic epilepsy, may facilitate efforts to characterize relevant epileptogenic mechanisms and to identify clinically effective antiepileptogenic treatments.

Summary
Despite the continuing lack of clinically effective agents for posttraumatic epilepsy prophylaxis, recent advances in basic and clinical research offer new hope for success in the development of new strategies for prevention and treatment.},

	abstract = {Spatial resolution in single-shot imaging is limited by signal attenuation due to relaxation of transverse magnetization. This effect can be reduced by minimizing acquisition times through the use of short interecho spacings. However, the minimum interecho spacing is constrained by limits on gradient switching rates, radiofrequency (RF) power deposition and RF pulse length. Recently, simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics (SMASH) has been introduced as a method to acquire magnetic resonance images at increased speeds using a reduced number of phase-encoding gradient steps by extracting spatial information contained in an RF coil array. In this study, it is shown that SMASH can be used to reduce the effects of relaxation, resulting in single-shot images with increased spatial resolution without increasing imaging time. After a brief theoretical discussion, two strategies to reduce signal attenuation and increase spatial resolution in single-shot imaging are introduced and their performance is evaluated in phantom studies. In vivo single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI), BURST, and half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) images are then presented demonstrating the practical implementation of these resolution enhancement strategies. Images acquired with SMASH show increased spatial resolution and improved image quality when compared with images obtained with the conventional acquisitions. The general principles presented for imaging with SMASH can also be applied to other partially parallel imaging techniques.},

The network approach sustains that epileptic networks have abnormal dynamics and functional connectivity (Holmes and Tucker, 2013), therefore, altering the information capacity in the brain. Here, we applied two new methods on patients suffering from childhood rolandic epilepsy: blind deconvolution method (Wu et al.,2013) to recover relevant information in spontaneous event-related fMRI and functional connectivity density (FCD; Tomasi and Volkow, 2010), a fast voxel-wise technique rooted in graph theory that asses hubs of information in the brain. The goal was to look for differences in the network architecture which can be used as indicators of a pathology even when it is not manifested. We found dysfunctional local connectivity in bilateral thalamus in the patients with inter epileptic discharges (IEDs) compared to patients with no IEDs, that is, there is subcortical network in RE distant from the seizure onset. Our result provides experimental evidence for the recent concept of epileptic network as oppose to the classical view of epilepsy as merely “focal” or “generalized” (Holmes and Tucker, 2013).},

However, changes in spontaneous neuronal functional organization in GTCS remain largely unknown., In this study, 70 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy characterized by tonic–clonic seizures and 70 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. Here, functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping, an ultrafast data-driven method based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), was applied for the first time to investigate the changes of spontaneous functional brain activity caused by epilepsy., The results showed significantly decreased long-range FCD in the middle and inferior temporal, prefrontal, and inferior parietal cortices as well as increased long-range FCD in the cerebellum anterior lobe and sensorimotor areas. Negative correlation between duration of disease and reduced long-range FCD was found. In addition, most regions with reduced long-range FCD showed decreased resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within default mode network., Negative correlation between duration of disease and long-range FCD may reflect an adverse consequence eventually from original. Furthermore, the observed FCD and rsFC alterations have been speculated to be associated with the social–cognitive impairments as well as motor control. Our study provided novel evidences to look into neuro-pathophysiological mechanisms underlying GTCS.},

We acquired FLASH images (TE = 60 msec) every 10 seconds over intervals of 10 minutes and derived activation images by subtracting baseline images from images obtained during clinical seizures. Functional MRI revealed sequential activation associated with specific gyri within the left hemisphere with each of five consecutive clinical seizures, and also during a period that was not associated with a detectable clinical seizure. The activated regions included gyri that were structurally abnormal.

This review examines recent reports on the use of advanced techniques to map the regions and networks involved during focal epileptic seizure generation in humans.

Recent findings
A number of imaging techniques are capable of providing new localizing information on the ictal processes and epileptogenic zone. Evaluating the clinical utility of these findings has been mainly performed through post-hoc comparison with the findings of invasive EEG and ictal single-photon emission computed tomography, using postsurgical seizure reduction as the main outcome measure. Added value has been demonstrated in MRI-negative cases. Improved understanding of the human ictiogenic processes and the focus vs. network hypothesis is likely to result from the application of multimodal techniques that combine electrophysiological, semiological, and whole-brain coverage of brain activity changes.

Summary
On the basis of recent research in the field of neuroimaging, several novel imaging modalities have been improved and developed to provide information about the localization of epileptic foci.},

Functional MRI (fMRI) is an important research method for investigating the neuroanatomic substrates of cognitive disorders and their treatment. Surprisingly, however, relatively little research has utilized fMRI to examine alterations in brain functioning after mTBI. This article provides a critical overview of the published fMRI research on mTBI to date. These topics include examination of frontal lobe/executive functions such as working memory, as well as episodic memory and resting state/functional connectivity. mTBI has also been investigated in military populations where studies have focused on effects of blast injury and comorbid conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder. Finally, we address fMRI evaluations of response to behavioral or pharmacological challenges and interventions targeting cognitive and behavioral sequelae of mTBI. The review concludes with identification and discussion of gaps in current knowledge and future directions for fMRI studies of mTBI. The authors conclude that fMRI in combination with related methods can be expected to play an increasing role in research related to studies of pathophysiological mechanisms of the sequelae of mTBI as well as in diagnosis and treatment monitoring.},

	abstract = {Brain activity data in general and more specifically in epilepsy can be represented as a matrix that includes measures of electrophysiology, anatomy and behaviour. Each of these sub-matrices has a complex interaction depending upon the brain state i.e., rest, cognition, seizures and interictal periods. This interaction presents significant challenges for interpretation but also potential for developing further insights into individual event types. Successful treatments in epilepsy hinge on unravelling these complexities, and also on the sensitivity and specificity of methods that characterize the nature and localization of underlying physiological and pathological networks. Limitations of pharmacological and surgical treatments call for refinement and elaboration of methods to improve our capability to localise the generators of seizure activity and our understanding of the neurobiology of epilepsy. Simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI), by potentially circumventing some of the limitations of EEG in terms of sensitivity, can allow the mapping of haemodynamic networks over the entire brain related to specific spontaneous and triggered epileptic events in humans, and thereby provide new localising information. In this work we review the published literature, and discuss the methods and utility of EEG-fMRI in localising the generators of epileptic activity. We draw on our experience and that of other groups, to summarise the spectrum of information provided by an increasing number of EEG-fMRI case-series, case studies and group studies in patients with epilepsy, for its potential role to elucidate epileptic generators and networks. We conclude that EEG-fMRI provides a multidimensional view that contributes valuable clinical information to localize the epileptic focus with potential important implications for the surgical treatment of some patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, and insights into the resting state and cognitive network dynamics.},

Methods: A review of selected articles dealing with epilepsy after brain trauma was undertaken. Results: The number of epidemiologic studies of posttraumatic seizures has increased substantially over the past 40–50 years, offering steadily increasing knowledge of the frequency, natural history, and risk factors of this well-recognized complication of TBI. In general, the incidence of posttraumatic seizures varies with the time period after injury and population age range under study, as well as the spectrum of severity of the inciting injuries, and has been reported to be anywhere from 4 to 53\%. As high as 86\% of patients with one seizure after TBI will have a second in the next 2 years. Longer-term remission rates of 25–40\% have been reported. Significant risk factors for the development of seizures in the first week after injury include acute intracerebral hematoma (especially subdural hematoma), younger age, increased injury severity, and chronic alcoholism. Significant risk factors for the development of seizures {\textgreater}1 week after TBI include seizures within the first week, acute intra-cerebral hematoma (especially subdural hematoma), brain contusion, increased injury severity, and age {\textgreater}65 years at the time of injury. Conclusions: Epilepsy is a frequent consequence of brain injury in both civilian and military populations. We understand some factors associated with its development, but there remain many unanswered questions.},

	abstract = {The sizes of Brodmann's areas 44 and 45 (Broca's speech region) and their extent in relation to macroscopic landmarks and surrounding areas differ considerably among the available cytoarchitectonic maps. Such variability may be due to intersubject differences in anatomy, observer-dependent discrepancies in cytoarchitectonic mapping, or both. Because a reliable definition of cytoarchitectonic borders is important for interpreting functional imaging data, we mapped areas 44 and 45 by means of an observer-independent technique. In 10 human brains, the laminar distributions of cell densities were measured vertical to the cortical surface in serial coronal sections stained for perikarya. Thousands of density profiles were obtained. Cytoarchitectonic borders were defined as statistically significant changes in laminar patterns. The analysis of the three-dimensional reconstructed brains and the two areas showed that cytoarchitectonic borders did not consistently coincide with sulcal contours. Therefore, macroscopic features are not reliable landmarks of cytoarchitectonic borders. Intersubject variability in the cytoarchitecture of areas 44 and 45 was significantly greater than cytoarchitectonic differences between these areas in individual brains. Although the volumes of area 44 differed across subjects by up to a factor of 10, area 44 but not area 45 was left-over-right asymmetrical in all brains. All five male but only three of five female brains had significantly higher cell densities on the left than on the right side. Such hemispheric and gender differences were not detected in area 45. These morphologic asymmetries of area 44 provide a putative correlate of the functional lateralization of speech production. J. Comp. Neurol. 412:319–341, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In this work, we address the question of which clustering technique is appropriate and how to optimize the corresponding model. We use two principled criteria: goodness of fit (accuracy), and reproducibility of the parcellation across bootstrap samples. We study these criteria on both simulated and two task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets for the Ward, spectral and K-means clustering algorithms. We show that in general Ward's clustering performs better than alternative methods with regards to reproducibility and accuracy and that the two criteria diverge regarding the preferred models (reproducibility leading to more conservative solutions), thus deferring the practical decision to a higher level alternative, namely the choice of a trade-off between accuracy and stability.},

Here we propose a 103 times faster method to map the distribution of the local functional connectivity density (lFCD) in the human brain. The robustness of this method was tested in 979 subjects from a large repository of MRI time series collected in resting conditions. Consistently across research sites, a region located in the posterior cingulate/ventral precuneus (BA 23/31) was the area with the highest lFCD, which suggest that this is the most prominent functional hub in the brain. In addition, regions located in the inferior parietal cortex (BA 18) and cuneus (BA 18) had high lFCD. The variability of this pattern across subjects was {\textless}36\% and within subjects was 12\%. The power scaling of the lFCD was consistent across research centers, suggesting that that brain networks have a “scale-free” organization.},

	abstract = {Multidimensional scaling can be considered as involving three basic steps. In the first step, a scale of comparative distances between all pairs of stimuli is obtained. This scale is analogous to the scale of stimuli obtained in the traditional paired comparisons methods. In this scale, however, instead of locating each stimulus-object on a given continuum, the distances between each pair of stimuli are located on a distance continuum. As in paired comparisons, the procedures for obtaining a scale of comparative distances leave the true zero point undetermined. Hence, a comparative distance is not a distance in the usual sense of the term, but is a distance minus an unknown constant. The second step involves estimating this unknown constant. When the unknown constant is obtained, the comparative distances can be converted into absolute distances. In the third step, the dimensionality of the psychological space necessary to account for these absolute distances is determined, and the projections of stimuli on axes of this space are obtained. A set of analytical procedures was developed for each of the three steps given above, including a least-squares solution for obtaining comparative distances by the complete method of triads, two practical methods for estimating the additive constant, and an extension of Young and Householder's Euclidean model to include procedures for obtaining the projections of stimuli on axes from fallible absolute distances.},

Well ahead of its time, the fMRIDC effort encountered logistical, sociocultural and funding barriers that impeded the field-wise instantiation of open-access data sharing. In 2009, ambitions for open-access data sharing were revived in the resting state functional MRI community in the form of two grassroots initiatives: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and its successor, the International Neuroimaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI). Beyond providing open access to thousands of clinical and non-clinical imaging datasets, the FCP and INDI have demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale data aggregation for hypothesis generation and testing. Yet, the success of the FCP and INDI should not be confused with widespread embracement of open-access data sharing. Reminiscent of the challenges faced by fMRIDC, key controversies persist and include participant privacy, the role of informatics, and the logistical and cultural challenges of establishing an open science ethos. We discuss the FCP and INDI in the context of these challenges, highlighting the promise of current initiatives and suggesting solutions for possible pitfalls.},

As the SVM has many unique properties, we examine the interpretation of support vector models with respect to neuroimaging data. We propose four methods for extracting activation maps from SVM models, and we examine one of these in detail.

	abstract = {During the last several years, the focus of research on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shifted from the analysis of functional connectivity averaged over the duration of scanning sessions to the analysis of changes of functional connectivity within sessions. Although several studies have reported the presence of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), statistical assessment of the results is not always carried out in a sound way and, in some studies, is even omitted. In this study, we explain why appropriate statistical tests are needed to detect dFC, we describe how they can be carried out and how to assess the performance of dFC measures, and we illustrate the methodology using spontaneous blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI recordings of macaque monkeys under general anesthesia and in human subjects under resting-state conditions. We mainly focus on sliding-window correlations since these are most widely used in assessing dFC, but also consider a recently proposed non-linear measure. The simulations and methodology, however, are general and can be applied to any measure. The results are twofold. First, through simulations, we show that in typical resting-state sessions of 10 min, it is almost impossible to detect dFC using sliding-window correlations. This prediction is validated by both the macaque and the human data: in none of the individual recording sessions was evidence for dFC found. Second, detection power can be considerably increased by session- or subject-averaging of the measures. In doing so, we found that most of the functional connections are in fact dynamic. With this study, we hope to raise awareness of the statistical pitfalls in the assessment of dFC and how they can be avoided by using appropriate statistical methods.},

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by functional dysconnectivity or abnormal integration between distant brain regions. Recent functional imaging studies have implicated large-scale thalamo-cortical connectivity as being disrupted in patients. However, observed connectivity differences in schizophrenia have been inconsistent between studies, with reports of hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity between the same brain regions. Using resting state eyes-closed functional imaging and independent component analysis on a multi-site data that included 151 schizophrenia patients and 163 age- and gender matched healthy controls, we decomposed the functional brain data into 100 components and identified 47 as functionally relevant intrinsic connectivity networks. We subsequently evaluated group differences in functional network connectivity, both in a static sense, computed as the pairwise Pearson correlations between the full network time courses (5.4 minutes in length), and a dynamic sense, computed using sliding windows (44 s in length) and k-means clustering to characterize five discrete functional connectivity states. Static connectivity analysis revealed that compared to healthy controls, patients show significantly stronger connectivity, i.e., hyperconnectivity, between the thalamus and sensory networks (auditory, motor and visual), as well as reduced connectivity (hypoconnectivity) between sensory networks from all modalities. Dynamic analysis suggests that (1), on average, schizophrenia patients spend much less time than healthy controls in states typified by strong, large-scale connectivity, and (2), that abnormal connectivity patterns are more pronounced during these connectivity states. In particular, states exhibiting cortical–subcortical antagonism (anti-correlations) and strong positive connectivity between sensory networks are those that show the group differences of thalamic hyperconnectivity and sensory hypoconnectivity. Group differences are weak or absent during other connectivity states. Dynamic analysis also revealed hypoconnectivity between the putamen and sensory networks during the same states of thalamic hyperconnectivity; notably, this finding cannot be observed in the static connectivity analysis. Finally, in post-hoc analyses we observed that the relationships between sub-cortical low frequency power and connectivity with sensory networks is altered in patients, suggesting different functional interactions between sub-cortical nuclei and sensorimotor cortex during specific connectivity states. While important differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls have been identified, one should interpret the results with caution given the history of medication in patients. Taken together, our results support and expand current knowledge regarding dysconnectivity in schizophrenia, and strongly advocate the use of dynamic analyses to better account for and understand functional connectivity differences.},

The HCP data will be a critical stepping-off point for future studies that will examine how variation in human structural and functional connectivity play a role in adult and pediatric neurological and psychiatric disorders that account for a huge amount of public health resources. Thus, the HCP is collecting behavioral measures of a range of motor, sensory, cognitive and emotional processes that will delineate a core set of functions relevant to understanding the relationship between brain connectivity and human behavior. In addition, the HCP is using task-fMRI (tfMRI) to help delineate the relationships between individual differences in the neurobiological substrates of mental processing and both functional and structural connectivity, as well as to help characterize and validate the connectivity analyses to be conducted on the structural and functional connectivity data. This paper describes the logic and rationale behind the development of the behavioral, individual difference, and tfMRI batteries and provides preliminary data on the patterns of activation associated with each of the fMRI tasks, at both a group and individual level.},

Here we developed a cortical parcellation approach to accurately map functional organization at the individual level using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A population-based functional atlas and a map of inter-individual variability were employed to guide the iterative search for functional networks in individual subjects. Functional networks mapped by this approach were highly reproducible within subjects and effectively captured the variability across subjects, including individual differences in brain lateralization. The algorithm performed well across different subject populations and data types, including task fMRI data. The approach was then validated by invasive cortical stimulation mapping in surgical patients, suggesting potential for use in clinical applications.

	abstract = {In functional magnetic resonance imaging statistical analysis there are problems with accounting for temporal autocorrelations when assessing change within voxels. Techniques to date have utilized temporal filtering strategies to either shape these autocorrelations or remove them. Shaping, or "coloring," attempts to negate the effects of not accurately knowing the intrinsic autocorrelations by imposing known autocorrelation via temporal filtering. Removing the autocorrelation, or "prewhitening," gives the best linear unbiased estimator, assuming that the autocorrelation is accurately known. For single-event designs, the efficiency of the estimator is considerably higher for prewhitening compared with coloring. However, it has been suggested that sufficiently accurate estimates of the autocorrelation are currently not available to give prewhitening acceptable bias. To overcome this, we consider different ways to estimate the autocorrelation for use in prewhitening. After high-pass filtering is performed, a Tukey taper (set to smooth the spectral density more than would normally be used in spectral density estimation) performs best. Importantly, estimation is further improved by using nonlinear spatial filtering to smooth the estimated autocorrelation, but only within tissue type. Using this approach when prewhitening reduced bias to close to zero at probability levels as low as 1 x 10(-5).},

Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between ±1.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous fluctuations of resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) have been widely used to understand the macro-connectome of the human brain. However, these fluctuations are not synchronized among subjects, which leads to limitations and makes utilization of first-level model-based methods challenging. Considering this limitation of rsfMRI data in the time domain, we propose to transfer the spatiotemporal information of the rsfMRI data to another domain, the connectivity domain, in which each value represents the same effect across subjects. Using a set of seed networks and a connectivity index to calculate the functional connectivity for each seed network, we transform data into the connectivity domain by generating connectivity weights for each subject. Comparison of the two domains using a data-driven method suggests several advantages in analyzing data using data-driven methods in the connectivity domain over the time domain. We also demonstrate the feasibility of applying model-based methods in the connectivity domain, which offers a new pathway for the use of first-level model-based methods on rsfMRI data. The connectivity domain, furthermore, demonstrates a unique opportunity to perform first-level feature-based data-driven and model-based analyses. The connectivity domain can be constructed from any technique that identifies sets of features that are similar across subjects and can greatly help researchers in the study of macro-connectome brain function by enabling us to perform a wide range of model-based and data-driven approaches on rsfMRI data, decreasing susceptibility of analysis techniques to parameters that are not related to brain connectivity information, and evaluating both static and dynamic functional connectivity of the brain from a new perspective.},

	abstract = {Cortical parcellation based on resting fMRI is an important tool for investigating the functional organization and connectivity of the cerebral cortex. Group parcellation based on co-registration of anatomical images to a common atlas will inevitably result in errors in the locations of the boundaries of functional parcels when they are mapped back from the atlas to the individual. This is because areas of functional specialization vary across individuals in a manner that cannot be fully determined from the sulcal and gyral anatomy that is used for mapping between atlas and individual. We describe a method that avoids this problem by refining an initial group parcellation so that for each subject the parcel boundaries are optimized with respect to that subject's resting fMRI. Initialization with a common parcellation results in automatic correspondence between parcels across subjects. Further, by using a group sparsity constraint to model connectivity, we exploit group similarities in connectivity between parcels while optimizing their boundaries for each individual. We applied this approach with initialization on both high and low density group cortical parcellations and used resting fMRI data to refine across a group of individuals. Cross validation studies show improved homogeneity of resting activity within the refined parcels. Comparisons with task-based localizers show consistent reduction of variance of statistical parametric maps within the refined parcels relative to the group-based initialization indicating improved delineation of regions of functional specialization. This method enables a more accurate estimation of individual subject functional areas, facilitating group analysis of functional connectivity, while maintaining consistency across individuals with a standardized topological atlas.},

Again it turns out that most configurations are reconstructible from the distribution of areas, though there are counterexamples. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Between-subject classification (BSC, multivariate pattern classification based on other subjects' data) of response-pattern vectors in common model space greatly exceeded BSC of anatomically aligned responses and matched within-subject classification.

	abstract = {Introduced is a general framework for performing group level analyses of fMRI data using any basis set of two functions (i.e. the canonical hemodynamic response function and its first derivative) to model the hemodynamic response to neural activity. The approach allows for flexible implementation of physiologically based restrictions on the results. Information from both basis functions is used at the group level and the limitations avoid physiologically ambiguous or implausible results. This allows for investigation of specific BOLD activity such as hemodynamic responses peaking within a specified temporal range (i.e. 4 to 5 seconds). The general nature of the presented approach allows for applications using basis sets specifically designed to investigate various physiologic phenomena, i.e. age-related variability in post-stimulus undershoot, hemodynamic responses measured with cerebral blood flow imaging or subject specific basis sets. An example using data from a group of healthy young participants demonstrates the methods and the specific steps to study post-stimulus variability are discussed. The approach is completely implemented within the general linear model and requires minimal programmatic calculations.},

	abstract = {Objective:
The purpose of this study was to investigate functional connectivity (FC) changes in epileptogenic networks in intractable partial epilepsy obtained from resting-state fMRI by using intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC), a voxel-based network measure of degree that reflects the number of connections to each voxel.

Methods:
We measured differences between intrahemispheric- and interhemispheric-ICC (ICCintra−inter) that could reveal localized connectivity abnormalities in epileptogenic zones while more global network changes would be eliminated when subtracting these values. The ICCintra−inter map was compared with the seizure onset zone (SOZ) based on intracranial EEG (icEEG) recordings in 29 patients with at least 1 year of postsurgical follow-up. Two independent reviewers blindly interpreted the icEEG and fMRI data, and the concordance rates were compared for various clinical factors.

Results:
Concordance between the icEEG SOZ and ICCintra−inter map was observed in 72.4\% (21/29) of the patients, which was higher in patients with good surgical outcome, especially in those patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) or lateral temporal seizure localization. Concordance was also better in the extratemporal lobe epilepsy than the TLE group. In 85.7\% (18/21) of the cases, the ICCintra−inter values were negative in the SOZ, indicating decreased FC within the epileptic hemisphere relative to between hemispheres.

Conclusions:
Assessing alterations in FC using fMRI-ICC map can help localize the SOZ, which has potential as a noninvasive presurgical diagnostic tool to improve surgical outcome. In addition, the method reveals that, in focal epilepsy, both intrahemispheric- and interhemispheric-FC may be altered, in the presence of both regional as well as global network abnormalities.},

	abstract = {The macro-connectome elucidates the pathways through which brain regions are structurally connected or functionally coupled to perform a specific cognitive task. It embodies the notion of representing and understanding all connections within the brain as a network, while the subdivision of the brain into interacting functional units is inherent in its architecture. As a result, the definition of network nodes is one of the most critical steps in connectivity network analysis. Although brain atlases obtained from cytoarchitecture or anatomy have long been used for this task, connectivity-driven methods have arisen only recently, aiming to delineate more homogeneous and functionally coherent regions. This study provides a systematic comparison between anatomical, connectivity-driven and random parcellation methods proposed in the thriving field of brain parcellation. Using resting-state functional MRI data from the Human Connectome Project and a plethora of quantitative evaluation techniques investigated in the literature, we evaluate 10 subject-level and 24 groupwise parcellation methods at different resolutions. We assess the accuracy of parcellations from four different aspects: (1) reproducibility across different acquisitions and groups, (2) fidelity to the underlying connectivity data, (3) agreement with fMRI task activation, myelin maps, and cytoarchitectural areas, and (4) network analysis. This extensive evaluation of different parcellations generated at the subject and group level highlights the strengths and shortcomings of the various methods and aims to provide a guideline for the choice of parcellation technique and resolution according to the task at hand. The results obtained in this study suggest that there is no optimal method able to address all the challenges faced in this endeavour simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Leftward volume asymmetry of the pars opercularis and pars triangularis may exist in the human brain, frequently referred to as Broca's area, given the functional asymmetries observed in this region with regard to language expression. However, post-mortem and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have failed to consistently identify such a volumetric asymmetry. In the present study, an analysis of the asymmetry of sulco-gyral anatomy and volume of this anterior speech region was performed in combination with an analysis of the morphology and volume asymmetry of the planum temporale, located within the posterior speech region, in 50 healthy subjects using MRI. Variations in sulcal anatomy were documented according to strict classification schemes and volume estimation of the grey matter within the brain structures was performed using the Cavalieri method of stereology. Results indicated great variation in the morphology of and connectivity between the inferior frontal, inferior precentral and diagonal sulci. There were significant inter-hemispheric differences in the presence of (1) the diagonal sulcus within the pars opercularis, and (2) horizontal termination of the posterior Sylvian fissure (relative to upward oblique termination), both with an increased leftward incidence. Double parallel inferior precentral sulci and absent anterior rami of the Sylvian fissure prevented stereological measurements in five subjects. Therefore volumes were obtained from 45 subjects. There was a significant leftward volume asymmetry of the pars opercularis (P = 0.02), which was significantly related to the asymmetrical presence of the diagonal sulcus (P {\textless} 0.01). Group-wise pars opercularis volume asymmetry did not exist when a diagonal sulcus was present in both or neither hemispheres. There was no significant volume asymmetry of the pars triangularis. There was a significant leftward volume asymmetry of the planum temporale (P {\textless} 0.001), which was significantly associated with the shape of the posterior Sylvian fissure as a unilateral right or left upward oblique termination was always associated with leftward or rightward volume asymmetry respectively (P {\textless} 0.01). There was no relationship between volume asymmetries of the anterior and posterior speech regions. Our findings illustrate the extent of morphological variability of the anterior speech region and demonstrate the difficulties encountered when determining volumetric asymmetries of the inferior frontal gyrus, particularly when sulci are discontinuous, absent or bifid. When the intrasulcal grey matter of this region is exhaustively sampled according to strict anatomical landmarks, the volume of the pars opercularis is leftward asymmetrical. This manuscript illustrates the importance of simultaneous consideration of brain morphology and morphometry in studies of cerebral asymmetry.},

Area 24 has three divisions of which area 24a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the least laminar differentiation. Area 24b has more clearly defined layers II, III, and Va, and area 24c, which forms the lower bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus, has a particularly dense layer III. Area 23 also has three divisions, each of which has a distinct layer IV. Area 23a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the thinnest layers II-IV, which have the same cell density as layers V and VI. Area 23b has the largest pyramids in layers IIIc and Va, and area 23c, in the depths of the posterior cingulate sulcus, has the broadest external and thinnest internal pyramidal layers. Finally, areas 29 and 30 are located in the posterior depths of the callosal sulcus. Two divisions of area 29 are apparent: one with a granular layer directly adjacent to layer I (area 29a-c) and another with differentiation of layers III and IV (area 29d). Area 30 has a dysgranular layer IV. Injections of the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into subdivisions of cingulate cortex in the monkey. Area 25 received thalamic input mainly from the midline parataenial (Pt), central densocellular (Cdc), and reuniens nuclei as well as from the dorsal parvicellular division of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDpc). A less dense projection also originated in the intralaminar parafascicular (Pf), central superior, and limitans (Li) nuclei as well as the medial division of the anterior nuclei (AM). Areas 24a and 24b received most thalamic afferents from fusiform and multipolar cells in the Cdc and Pf nuclei with fewer from the ventral anterior (VA) and MDpc and MD densocellular (MDdc) nuclei and only minor input from AM. Most input to premotor cingulate area 24c appeared to originate in VA, MDdc, and Li. Area 29 received the most dense input from nuclei traditionally associated with limbic cortex including the anteroventral (AV), anterodorsal (AD), and laterodorsal (LD) nuclei. Areas 23a and 23b, in contrast, did not receive AV, AD, or LD input, but the greatest proportion of their thalamic afferents arose in AM. Less-pronounced input also came from the lateroposterior (LP), medial pulvinar, and MDdc nuclei.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {The neuronal composition of the insula in primates displays a gradient, transitioning from granular neocortex in the posterior-dorsal insula to agranular neocortex in the anterior-ventral insula with an intermediate zone of dysgranularity. Additionally, apes and humans exhibit a distinctive subdomain in the agranular insula, the frontoinsular cortex (FI), defined by the presence of clusters of von Economo neurons (VENs). Studies in humans indicate that the ventral anterior insula, including agranular insular cortex and FI, is involved in social awareness, and that the posterodorsal insula, including granular and dysgranular cortices, produces an internal representation of the body's homeostatic state. We examined the volumes of these cytoarchitectural areas of insular cortex in 30 primate species, including the volume of FI in apes and humans. Results indicate that the whole insula scales hyperallometrically (exponent = 1.13) relative to total brain mass, and the agranular insula (including FI) scales against total brain mass with even greater positive allometry (exponent = 1.23), providing a potential neural basis for enhancement of social cognition in association with increased brain size. The relative volumes of the subdivisions of the insular cortex, after controlling for total brain volume, are not correlated with species typical social group size. Although its size is predicted by primate-wide allometric scaling patterns, we found that the absolute volume of the left and right agranular insula and left FI are among the most differentially expanded of the human cerebral cortex compared to our closest living relative, the chimpanzee.},

These functional connectivity patterns were differentiated from the more ventral networks associated with the posterior cingulate, which connected with limbic structures such as the medial temporal cortex, dorsal and ventromedial prefrontal regions, posterior lateral inferior parietal regions, and the lateral temporal cortex. Our findings are consistent with predictions from anatomical tracer studies in the monkey, and provide support that resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) may in part reflect underlying anatomy. These subdivisions within the precuneus suggest that neuroimaging studies will benefit from treating this region as anatomically (and thus functionally) heterogeneous. Furthermore, the consistency between functional connectivity networks in monkeys and humans provides support for RSFC as a viable tool for addressing cross-species comparisons of functional neuroanatomy.},

Functional connectivity MR imaging is used to map regions of the resting brain showing synchronous, regional and slow fluctuations in cerebral blood flow and oxygenation. In this study, we use a hierarchical clustering method to detect similarities of low-frequency fluctuations. We describe one measure of correlations in the low frequency range for classification of resting-state fMRI data. Furthermore, we investigate the contribution of motion and hardware instabilities to resting-state correlations and provide a method to reduce artifacts. For all cortical regions studied and clusters obtained, we quantify the degree of contamination of functional connectivity maps by the respiratory and cardiac cycle. Results indicate that patterns of functional connectivity can be obtained with hierarchical clustering that resemble known neuronal connections. The corresponding voxel time series do not show significant correlations in the respiratory or cardiac frequency band.},

We review recent in vivo myelin mapping studies and discuss some of the different methods for estimating myelin content. We discuss some ways in which myelin maps may improve surface registration and be useful for cross-modal and cross-species comparisons, including some preliminary cross-species results. Next, we consider neurobiological aspects of why some parts of cortex are more myelinated than others. Myelin content is inversely correlated with intracortical circuit complexity - in general, more myelin content means simpler and perhaps less dynamic intracortical circuits. Using existing PET data and functional network parcellations, we examine metabolic differences in the differently myelinated cortical functional networks. Lightly myelinated cognitive association networks tend to have higher aerobic glycolysis than heavily myelinated early sensory-motor ones, perhaps reflecting greater ongoing dynamic anabolic cortical processes. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that intracortical myelination may stabilize intracortical circuits and inhibit synaptic plasticity. Finally, we discuss the future of the in vivo myeloarchitectural field and cortical parcellation--"in vivo Brodmann mapping"--in general.},

We present a patient with intractable parietal lobe epilepsy arising from a lesion localized to the right precuneus. Two seizure types with distinct semiologies were captured on video-EEG monitoring. The first type consisted of an urge described as a "feeling of wanting to move". On video analysis, the patient is seen to turn his head and body to his left. He remains conscious, he is able to answer questions and when asked, he can look to his right. This seizure was associated with an ictal pattern localized to the right parieto-occipital region. The second seizure type consisted of reading-induced visual distortion with macropsia and micropsia. Interictally, intermittent rhythmic slowing and spikes were seen and localized to the parietal midline and the right parieto-occipital regions. Our patient's seizures are positive phenomena of the right precuneus and its related processing network. They represent unique seizure semiologies that offer further insight into the role of the precuneus in spatial awareness, visuo-spatial processing and consciousness.},

	abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.},

The total surface area of the reconstructed Visible Man neocortex is 1570 cm2(both hemispheres), ∼70\% of which is buried in sulci. By linking the Visible Man cerebrum to the Talairach stereotaxic coordinate space, the locations of activation foci reported in neuroimaging studies can be readily visualized in relation to the cortical surface. The associated spatial uncertainty was empirically shown to have a radius in three dimensions of ∼10 mm. Application of this approach to studies of visual cortex reveals the overall patterns of activation associated with different aspects of visual function and the relationship of these patterns to topographically organized visual areas. Our analysis supports a distinction between an anterior region in ventral occipito-temporal cortex that is selectively involved in form processing and a more posterior region (in or near areas VP and V4v) involved in both form and color processing. Foci associated with motion processing are mainly concentrated in a region along the occipito-temporal junction, the ventral portion of which overlaps with foci also implicated in form processing. Comparisons between flat maps of human and macaque monkey cerebral cortex indicate significant differences as well as many similarities in the relative sizes and positions of cortical regions known or suspected to be homologous in the two species.},

We characterized 97 new areas and 83 areas previously reported using post-mortem microscopy or other specialized study-specific approaches. To enable automated delineation and identification of these areas in new HCP subjects and in future studies, we trained a machine-learning classifier to recognize the multi-modal 'fingerprint' of each cortical area.

The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster.

Here we used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) in humans and macaques to infer and compare the organization of dorsal frontal cortex in the two species. Using DW-MRI tractography-based parcellation, we identified 10 dorsal frontal regions lying between the human inferior frontal sulcus and cingulate cortex. Patterns of functional coupling between each area and the rest of the brain were then estimated with fMRI and compared with functional coupling patterns in macaques. Areas in human medial frontal cortex, including areas associated with high-level social cognitive processes such as theory of mind, showed a surprising degree of similarity in their functional coupling patterns with the frontal pole, medial prefrontal, and dorsal prefrontal convexity in the macaque. We failed to find evidence for "new" regions in human medial frontal cortex. On the lateral surface, comparison of functional coupling patterns suggested correspondences in anatomical organization distinct from those that are widely assumed. A human region sometimes referred to as lateral frontal pole more closely resembled area 46, rather than the frontal pole, of the macaque. Overall the pattern of results suggest important similarities in frontal cortex organization in humans and other primates, even in the case of regions thought to carry out uniquely human functions.

Human ventrolateral frontal cortex (vlFC) is identified with cognitive processes such as language and cognitive flexibility. The relationship between it and the vlFC of other primates has therefore been the subject of particular speculation. We used a combination of structural and functional neuroimaging methods to identify key components of human vlFC. We compared how vlFC areas interacted with other brain areas in 25 humans and 25 macaques using the same methods. We identified a core set of 11 vlFC components that interacted in similar ways with similar distributed circuits in both species and, in addition, one distinctively human component in ventrolateral frontal pole. Fundamental differences in interactions with posterior auditory association areas in the two species were also present—these were ubiquitous throughout posterior human vlFC but channeled to different frontal regions in monkeys. Finally, there were some differences in interregional interactions within vlFC in the two species.},

During each session, subjects performed an episodic retrieval task, a semantic retrieval task, and a working memory task. We found that 1) despite extensive intersubject variability in the pattern of activity across the whole brain, individual activity patterns were stable over time, 2) activity patterns of the same individual performing different tasks were more similar than activity patterns of different individuals performing the same task, and 3) that individual differences in decision criterion on a recognition test predicted the degree of similarity between any two individuals' patterns of brain activity, but individual differences in memory accuracy or similarity in structural anatomy did not. These results imply that the exclusive use of group maps may be ineffective in profiling the pattern of activations for a given task. This may be particularly true for a task like episodic retrieval, which is relatively strategic and can involve widely distributed specialized processes that are peripheral to the actual retrieval of stored information. Further, these processes may be differentially engaged depending on individual differences in cognitive processing and/or physiology.},

Descriptions of human parietal cortex draw heavily on anatomical schemes developed in other primate species, but the validity of such comparisons has been questioned by claims that there are fundamental differences between the parietal cortex in humans and other primates. A scheme is presented for parcellation of human lateral parietal cortex into component regions on the basis of anatomical connectivity and the functional interactions of the resulting clusters with other brain regions. Anatomical connectivity was estimated using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI)-based tractography, and functional interactions were assessed by correlations in activity measured with functional MRI at rest. Resting-state functional connectivity was also assessed directly in the rhesus macaque lateral parietal cortex in an additional experiment, and the patterns found reflected known neuroanatomical connections. Cross-correlation in the tractography-based connectivity patterns of parietal voxels reliably parcellated human lateral parietal cortex into 10 component clusters. The resting-state functional connectivity of human superior parietal and intraparietal clusters with frontal and extrastriate cortex suggested correspondences with areas in macaque superior and intraparietal sulcus. Functional connectivity patterns with parahippocampal cortex and premotor cortex again suggested fundamental correspondences between inferior parietal cortex in humans and macaques. In contrast, the human parietal cortex differs in the strength of its interactions between the central inferior parietal lobule region and the anterior prefrontal cortex.},

This spectator progress, however, poses a critical problem for neuroscientists and practitioners of brain-related professions: how to find their way in the current tomographic images so as to identify a particular brain site, be it normal or damaged by disease? The problem is made all the more difficult by the large degree of individual neuroanatomical variation. Prepared by a leading expert in advanced brain-imaging techniques, this unique atlas is a guide to the localization of brain structures that illustrates the wide range of neuranatomical variation. It is based on the analysis of 29 normal brain obtained from three-dimensional reconstructions of magnetic resonance scans of living persons. It also provides 177 section (coronal, axial, and parasagital) of one of those brains so that the same structure presented in the section obtained in one incidence can be identified in the section of another incidence. An additional 209 sections of two incidences of two other brains with different overall configurations are included at the same incidences, so that readers can become familiar with the variability of standard images prompted by different skull shapes. Forty-six normal brains, segmented in to the major lobes, are also included. The atlas is based on a voxel-rendering technique developed in the author's laboratory that permits the reconstruction of the brain in three dimensions. The technique permits the identification of major sulci and gyri with about the same degree of precision that can be achieved at the autopsy table. The volume contains 50 pages of color illustrations. The Second Edition of this atlas offers entirely new images, all from new brain specimens. Like the first edition, it will prove to be an essential tool for neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, psychiatrists, and neuroscientists, as well as medical and neuroscience students.},

	abstract = {Explicit segmentation is required for many forms of quantitative neuroanatomic analysis. However, manual methods are time-consuming and subject to errors in both accuracy and reproducibility (precision). A 3-D model-based segmentation method is presented in this paper for the completely automatic identification and delineation of gross anatomical structures of the human brain based on their appearance in magnetic resonance images (MRI). The approach depends on a general, iterative, hierarchical non-linear registration procedure and a 3-D digital model of human brain anatomy that contains both volumetric intensity-based data and a geometric atlas. Here, the traditional segmentation strategy is inverted: instead of matching geometric contours from and idealized atlas directly to the MRI data, segmentation is achieved by identifying the non-linear spatial transformation that best maps corresponding intensity-based features between a model image and a new MRI brain volume. When completed, atlas contours defined on the model image are mapped through the same transformation to segment and label individual structures in the new data set. Using manually segmented sturcture boundaries for comparison, measures of volumetric difference and volumetric overlap were less than 2\% and better than 97\% for realistic brain phantom data, and less than 10\% and better than 85\%, respectively, for human MRI data. This compares favorably to intra-observer variability estimates of 4.9\% and 87\%, respectively. The procedure performs well, is objective and its implementation robust. The procedure requires no manual intervention, and is thus applicable to studies of large numbers of subjects. The general method for non-linear image matching is also useful for non-linear mapping of brain data sets into stereotaxic space if the target volume is already in stereotaxic space. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {This article outlines a theoretical framework for the understanding of the neural basis of memory and consciousness, at systems level. It proposes an architecture constituted by: (1) neuron ensembles located in multiple and separate regions of primary and first-order sensory association cortices (“early cortices”) and motor cortices; they contain representations of feature fragments inscribed as patterns of activity originally engaged by perceptuomotor interactions; (2) neuron ensembles located downstream from the former throughout single modality cortices (local convergence zones); they inscribe amodal records of the combinatorial arrangement of feature fragments that occurred synchronously during the experience of entities or events in sector (1); (3) neuron ensembles located downstream from the former throughout higher-order association cortices (non-local convergence zones), which inscribe amodal records of the synchronous combinatorial arrangements of local convergence zones during the experience of entities and events in sector (1); (4) feed-forward and feedback projections interlocking reciprocally the neuron ensembles in (1) with those in (2) according to a many-to-one (feed-forward) and one-to-many (feedback) principle. I propose that (a) recall of entities and events occurs when the neuron ensembles in (1) are activated in time-locked fashion; (b) the synchronous activations are directed from convergence zones in (2) and (3); and (c) the process of reactivation is triggered from firing in convergence zones and mediated by feedback projections. This proposal rejects a single anatomical site for the integration of memory and motor processes and a single store for the meaning of entities of events. Meaning is reached by time-locked multiregional retroactivation of widespread fragment records. Only the latter records can become contents of consciousness.},

	abstract = {Digital and print brain atlases have been used with success to help in the planning of neurosurgical interventions. In this paper, a technique presented for the creation of a brain atlas of the basal ganglia and the thalamus derived from serial histological data. Photographs of coronal histological sections were digitized and anatomical structures were manually segmented. A slice-to-slice nonlinear registration technique was used to correct for spatial distortions introduced into the histological data set at the time of acquisition. Since the histological data were acquired without any anatomical reference (e.g., block-face imaging, post-mortem MRI), this registration technique was optimized to use an error metric which calculates a nonlinear transformation minimizing the mean distance between the segmented contours between adjacent pairs of slices in the data set. A voxel-by-voxel intensity correction field was also estimated for each slice to correct for lighting and staining inhomogeneity. The reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) histological volume can be viewed in transverse and sagittal directions in addition to the original coronal.
Nonlinear transformations used to correct for spatial distortions of the histological data were applied to the segmented structure contours. These contours were then tessellated to create three-dimensional geometric objects representing the different anatomic regions in register with the histological volumes. This yields two alternate representations (one histological and one geometric) of the atlas.
To register the atlas to a standard reference MR volume created from the average of 27 T1-weighted MR volumes, a pseudo-MRI was created by setting the intensity of each anatomical region defined in the geometric atlas to match the intensity of the corresponding region of the reference MR volume. This allowed the estimation of a 3D nonlinear transformation using a correlation based registration scheme to fit the atlas to the reference MRI.
The result of this procedure is a contiguous 3D histological volume, a set of 3D objects defining the basal ganglia and thalamus, both of which are registered to a standard MRI data set, for use for neurosurgical planning.},

	abstract = {Manually labeled landmark sets are often required as inputs for landmark-based image registration. Identifying an optimal subset of landmarks from a training dataset may be useful in reducing the labor intensive task of manual labeling. In this paper, we present a new problem and a method to solve it: given a set of N landmarks, find the k({\textbackslash}textless N) best landmarks such that aligning these k landmarks that produce the best overall alignment of all N landmarks. The resulting procedure allows us to select a reduced number of landmarks to be labeled as a part of the registration procedure. We apply this methodology to the problem of registering cerebral cortical surfaces extracted from MRI data. We use manually traced sulcal curves as landmarks in performing inter-subject registration of these surfaces. To minimize the error metric, we analyze the correlation structure of the sulcal errors in the landmark points by modeling them as a multivariate Gaussian process. Selection of the optimal subset of sulcal curves is performed by computing the error variance for the subset of unconstrained landmarks conditioned on the constrained set. We show that the registration error predicted by our method closely matches the actual registration error. The method determines optimal curve subsets of any given size with minimal registration error.},

We demonstrate a corresponding method for group analysis that avoids the need for spatial correspondence among subjects. Consistency of the selectivity profiles across subjects provides a way to assess the validity of the discovered systems. We validate this model in the context of category selectivity in visual cortex, demonstrating good agreement with the findings based on prior hypothesis-driven methods. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The loss pattern was visualized in four dimensions as it spread over time from temporal and limbic cortices into frontal and occipital brain regions, sparing sensorimotor cortices. The shifting deficits were asymmetric (left hemisphere {\textbackslash}textgreater right hemisphere) and correlated with progressively declining cognitive status (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.0006). Novel brain mapping methods allowed us to visualize dynamic patterns of atrophy in 52 high-resolution magnetic resonance image scans of 12 patients with AD (age 68.4 +/- 1.9 years) and 14 elderly matched controls (age 71.4 +/- 0.9 years) scanned longitudinally (two scans; interscan interval 2.1 +/- 0.4 years). A cortical pattern matching technique encoded changes in brain shape and tissue distribution across subjects and time. Cortical atrophy occurred in a well defined sequence as the disease progressed, mirroring the sequence of neurofibrillary tangle accumulation observed in cross sections at autopsy. Advancing deficits were visualized as dynamic maps that change over time. Frontal regions, spared early in the disease, showed pervasive deficits later ({\textbackslash}textgreater15\% loss). The maps distinguished different phases of AD and differentiated AD from normal aging. Local gray matter loss rates (5.3 +/- 2.3\% per year in AD v 0.9 +/- 0.9\% per year in controls) were faster in the left hemisphere (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.029) than the right. Transient barriers to disease progression appeared at limbic/frontal boundaries. This degenerative sequence, observed in vivo as it developed, provides the first quantitative, dynamic visualization of cortical atrophic rates in normal elderly populations and in those with dementia.},

Most notable among these are the improvements made to the standard algorithm for the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method and treatment of absorbing boundary conditions in FDTD, finite element, and transmission-line-matrix methods. The author also added a chapter on the method of lines.Numerical Techniques in Electromagnetics continues to teach readers how to pose, numerically analyze, and solve EM problems, give them the ability to expand their problem-solving skills using a variety of methods, and prepare them for research in electromagnetism.

	abstract = {We propose a novel framework, aspect space, to balance deformability and discriminability, which are often two competing factors in shape and image representations. In this framework, an object is embedded as a surface in a higher dimensional space with a parameter named aspect weight, which controls the importance of intensity in the embedding. We show that this framework naturally unifies existing important shape and image representations by adjusting the aspect weight and the embedding. More importantly, we find that the aspect weight implicitly controls the degree to which a representation handles deformation. Based on this idea, we present the aspect shape context, which extends shape context-based descriptors and adaptively selects the “best” aspect weight for shape comparison. Another observation we have is the proposed descriptor nicely fits context-sensitive shape retrieval. The proposed methods are evaluated on two public datasets, MPEG7-CE-Shape-1 and Tari 1000, in comparison to state-of-the-art solutions. In the standard shape retrieval experiment using the MPEG7 CE-Shape-1 database, the new descriptor with context information achieves a bull's eye score of 95.96\%, which surpassed all previous results. In the Tari 1000 dataset, our methods significantly outperform previous tested methods as well.},

	abstract = {Current advances in neurosciences deal with the functional architecture of the central nervous system, paving the way for general theories that improve our understanding of brain activity. From topology, a strong concept comes into play in understanding brain functions, namely, the 4D space of a “hypersphere's torus”, undetectable by observers living in a 3D world. The torus may be compared with a video game with biplanes in aerial combat: when a biplane flies off one edge of gaming display, it does not crash but rather it comes back from the opposite edge of the screen. Our thoughts exhibit similar behaviour, i.e. the unique ability to connect past, present and future events in a single, coherent picture as if we were allowed to watch the three screens of past-present-future “glued” together in a mental kaleidoscope. Here we hypothesize that brain functions are embedded in a imperceptible fourth spatial dimension and propose a method to empirically assess its presence. Neuroimaging fMRI series can be evaluated, looking for the topological hallmark of the presence of a fourth dimension. Indeed, there is a typical feature which reveal the existence of a functional hypersphere: the simultaneous activation of areas opposite each other on the 3D cortical surface. Our suggestion—substantiated by recent findings—that brain activity takes place on a closed, donut-like trajectory helps to solve long-standing mysteries concerning our psychological activities, such as mind-wandering, memory retrieval, consciousness and dreaming state.},

The measure of similarity is defined in terms of the amount of transformation required. The shapes are represented by sparse-point or continuous-contour representations depending on the form of the data. We formulate the problem as probabilistic inference using a generative model and the EM algorithm. But this algorithm has problems with initialization and computing the E-step. To address these problems, we define a data-driven technique (discriminative model) which makes use of shape features. This gives a hybrid algorithm which combines the generative and discriminative models. The resulting algorithm is very fast, due to the effectiveness of shape-features for solving correspondence requiring only a few iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by testing it on standard datasets, such as MPEG7, for shape matching and by applying it to a range of matching, registration, and foreground/background segmentation problems.},

Signature histogram and k th order augmented histogram have all invariance properties [17]. But,they are applicable only to convex shapes. This representation scheme assumes that centroid to contour distance is a functionof angle (with a predefined axis). This is not true for non-convex and open shapes, since for some angles there can be more than onecentroid to contour distance. The current paper does not make this assumption, but considers distribution of centroid tocontour distances. Further, to reduce the false positive rate, distribution of local variations of the centroid contour distancesare also considered.

In a symmetrical environment, their receptive fields (place fields) are oriented by visual cues, and if these are unavailable they are oriented by movement-generated (idiothetic) cues. The present study tested the hypothesis that the cells would learn not to ‘trust' a visual cue if the rat experienced it to be unstable (Knierim et al., 1995. Place cells, head direction cells and the learning of landmark stability. J. Neurosci. 15, 1648–1659). In an otherwise symmetrical environment, a visual cue was moved with respect to the idiothetic cues, either in sight or out-of-sight of the rat. When the visual cue was moved out-of-sight of the rat, place fields were initially oriented by this cue in preference to the idiothetic cues. However, if the cue was seen by the rat to be mobile, place fields ceased following the visual cue and became oriented by the idiothetic cues instead. If the cue was not seen to be mobile until the rat had had several days of experience in the environment, then the fields continued to be oriented by the (now visibly mobile) visual cue. It thus appears that the orienting influence of a visual cue on place fields can be either strengthened or weakened relative to the idiothetic cues, depending on the experience of the rat},

This situation calls for regularization techniques which are defined over non flat surfaces. We introduce in this paper the Beltrami flow over manifolds. This new regularization technique overcomes the over-smoothing of the L\_2 flow and the staircasing effects of the L\_1 flow, that were recently suggested via the harmonic map methods. The key of our approach is first to clarify the link between the intrinsic Polyakov action and the implicit Harmonic energy functional and then use the geometrical understanding of the Beltrami Flow to generalize it to images on explicitly and implicitly defined non flat surfaces. It is shown that once again the Beltrami flow interpolates between the L\_2 and L\_1 flows on non-flat surfaces. The implementation scheme of this flow is presented and various experimental results obtained on a set of various real images illustrate the performances of the approach as well as the differences with the harmonic map flows. This extension of the Beltrami flow to the case of non flat surfaces opens new perspectives in the regularization of noisy data defined on manifolds.},

For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach—we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method.},

Both inexact and exact landmark matching is studied here. Given noisy landmarks xn matched to yn measured with error covariances Sigman, then the matching problem is solved generating the optimal diffeomorphism phi;(x,1)=integral0(1)nu(phi(x,t),t)dt+x where nu(.)=argmin(nu.)integral1(0) integralOmega parallelLnu(x,t) parallel2dxdt +Sigman=1N[yn-phi(xn,1)] TSigman(-1)[yn-phi(xn,1)].

In this paper, we first analyze different discretizations of the Laplace–Beltrami operator (geometric Laplacians, linear and cubic FEM operators) in terms of the correctness of their eigenfunctions with respect to the continuous case. We then present the family of segmentations induced by the nodal sets of the eigenfunctions, discussing its meaningfulness for shape understanding.},

	abstract = {Converging theories and data suggest that atypical patterns of functional and structural connectivity are a hallmark neurobiological feature of autism. However, empirical studies of functional connectivity, or, the correlation of MRI signal between brain regions, have largely been conducted during task performance and/or focused on group differences within one network [e.g., the default mode network (DMN)]. This narrow focus on task-based connectivity and single network analyses precludes investigation of whole-brain intrinsic network organization in autism. To assess whole-brain network properties in adolescents with autism, we collected resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) data from neurotypical (NT) adolescents and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We used graph theory metrics on rs-fcMRI data with 34 regions of interest (i.e., nodes) that encompass four different functionally defined networks: cingulo-opercular, cerebellar, fronto-parietal, and DMN (Fair etal., 2009). Contrary to our hypotheses, network analyses revealed minimal differences between groups with one exception. Betweenness centrality, which indicates the degree to which a seed (or node) functions as a hub within and between networks, was greater for participants with autism for the right lateral parietal (RLatP) region of the DMN. Follow-up seed-based analyses demonstrated greater functional connectivity in ASD than NT groups between the RLatP seed and another region of the DMN, the anterior medial prefrontal cortex. Greater connectivity between these regions was related to lower ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) scores (i.e., lower impairment) in autism. These findings do not support current theories of underconnectivity in autism, but, rather, underscore the need for future studies to systematically examine factors that can influence patterns of intrinsic connectivity such as autism severity, age, and head motion.},

In order to address the need for a more natural surface-based coordinate system for the cortex, we have developed a means for generating an average folding pattern across a large number of individual subjects as a function on the unit sphere and of nonrigidly aligning each individual with the average. This establishes a spherical surface-based coordinate system that is adapted to the folding pattern of each individual subject, allowing for much higher localization accuracy of structural and functional features of the human brain.},

Results indicate cross-sectional age effects in mean thickness, GM volume, sulcal depth, and curvature characteristics of sulcal regions.

We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

This focus on neural circuitry has rendered resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) an increasingly important role in the elucidation of pathophysiology including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Unlike many other MRI techniques that focus on the properties of discrete brain regions, rs-fcMRI measures the coherence of neural activity across anatomically disparate brain regions, examining the connectivity and organization of neural circuits. In this review, we explore the methods available to investigators using rs-fcMRI techniques, including a discussion of their relative merits and limitations. We then review findings from extant rs-fcMRI studies of ADHD focusing on neural circuits implicated in the disorder, especially the default mode network, cognitive control network, and cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops. We conclude by suggesting future directions that may help advance subsequent rs-fcMRI research in ADHD.},

Given an initial estimate of its position (perhaps based on dead-reckoning) and an image taken of a known environment, our agent first attempts to locate a set of landmarks (real-world objects at known locations), then uses their angular separation to obtain an improved estimate of its current position. Unfortunately, some landmarks may not be visible, or worse, may be confused with other landmarks, resulting in both time wasted in searching for the undetected landmarks, and in further errors in the agent's estimate of its position. To address these problems, we propose a method that uses previous experiences to learn a selection function that, given the set of landmarks that might be visible, returns the subset that can be used to reliably provide an accurate registration of the agent's position. We use statistical techniques to prove that the learned selection function is, with high probability, effectively at a local optimum in the space of such functions. This paper also presents empirical evidence, using real-world data, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

Such an isotropic diffusion (ISD) based smoothing is widely adopted for denoising purpose due to its easy implementation and efficient computation. Beyond these advantages, Gaussian smoothing kernels tend to blur the edges, curvature and texture of images. Researchers have proposed anisotropic diffusion (ASD) and non-local diffusion (NLD) kernels. We recently demonstrated the effect of these new filtering paradigms on preprocessing real degraded MRI images from three individual subjects. Here, to further systematically investigate the effects at a group level, we collected both structural and functional MRI data from 23 participants. We first evaluated the three smoothing strategies' impact on brain extraction, segmentation and registration. Finally, we investigated how they affect subsequent mapping of default network based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) data. Our findings suggest that NLD-based spatial smoothing maybe more effective and reliable at improving the quality of both MRI data preprocessing and default network mapping. We thus recommend NLD may become a promising method of smoothing structural MRI images of R-fMRI pipeline.},

In this work, we propose a fully automated and robust approach to extract corpus callosum from T1-weighted structural MR images. The novelty of our method is composed of two key steps. In the first step, we find an initial guess for the curve representation of CC by using the zero level set of the first nontrivial Laplace-Beltrami (LB) eigenfunction on the white matter surface. In the second step, the initial curve is deformed toward the final solution with a geodesic curvature flow on the white matter surface. For numerical solution of the geodesic curvature flow on surfaces, we represent the contour implicitly on a triangular mesh and develop efficient numerical schemes based on finite element method. Because our method depends only on the intrinsic geometry of the white matter surface, it is robust to orientation differences of the brain across population. In our experiments, we validate the proposed algorithm on 32 brains from a clinical study of multiple sclerosis disease and demonstrate that the accuracy of our results.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been ever-increasing interest in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) for better understanding the link between cortical activity and connectivity, respectively. However, it is challenging to detect and validate fMRI activity in key sub-cortical areas such as the thalamus, given that they are prone to susceptibility artifacts due to the partial volume effects (PVE) of surrounding tissues (GM/WM interface). This is especially true on relatively low-field clinical MR systems (e.g., 1.5 T). We propose to overcome this limitation by using a spatial denoising technique used in structural MRI and more recently in diffusion MRI called non-local means (NLM) denoising, which uses a patch-based approach to suppress the noise locally. To test this, we measured fMRI in 20 healthy subjects performing three block-based tasks : eyes-open closed (EOC) and left/right finger tapping (FTL, FTR). Overall, we found that NLM yielded more thalamic activity compared to traditional denoising methods. In order to validate our pipeline, we also investigated known structural connectivity going through the thalamus using HARDI tractography: the optic radiations, related to the EOC task, and the cortico-spinal tract (CST) for FTL and FTR. To do so, we reconstructed the tracts using functionally based thalamic and cortical ROIs to initiates seeds of tractography in a two-level coarse-to-fine fashion. We applied this method at the single subject level, which allowed us to see the structural connections underlying fMRI thalamic activity. In summary, we propose a new fMRI processing pipeline which uses a recent spatial denoising technique (NLM) to successfully detect sub-cortical activity which was validated using an advanced dMRI seeding strategy in single subjects at 1.5 T.},

The key idea is to implicitly represent the surface as the level set of a higher dimensional function and solve the problem in a fixed Cartesian coordiante system using this new embedding function. When this is combined with the general theory of harmonic maps, we can address such problems as intrinsic regularization of data defined on the surface and pattern generation using the intrinsic surface geometry. We describe the basic technique andpresent examples in image procesing and computer graphics. More precisely, we address the problems of isotropic and anisotropic regularization of images and direction maps defined on ths surface and the problem of intrinsic texture synthesis.},

	abstract = {The Human Connectome Project (HCP) faces the challenging task of bringing multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities together in a common automated preprocessing framework across a large cohort of subjects. The MRI data acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on conventional 3. Tesla scanners and often require newly developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future improvements to the pipelines. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We here present a new approach to make use of three-dimensional probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps, as obtained from the analysis of human post-mortem brains, for correlating microscopical, anatomical and functional imaging data of the cerebral cortex. We introduce a new, MATLAB based toolbox for the SPM2 software package which enables the integration of probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps and results of functional imaging studies. The toolbox includes the functionality for the construction of summary maps combining probability of several cortical areas by finding the most probable assignment of each voxel to one of these areas. Its main feature is to provide several measures defining the degree of correspondence between architectonic areas and functional foci. The software, together with the presently available probability maps, is available as open source software to the neuroimaging community. This new toolbox provides an easy-to-use tool for the integrated analysis of functional and anatomical data in a common reference space. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A selective distribution of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological lesions in specific cortical layers isolates the hippocampus from the rest of the brain. However, functional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions remains unclear in AD. Here, we employ a resting state functional MRI (fMRI) to examine changes in hippocampal connectivity comparing 13 patients with mild AD versus 13 healthy age-matched controls. Hippocampal connectivity was investigated by examination of the correlation between low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the hippocampus and those in all other brain regions. We found that functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and a set of regions was disrupted in AD; these regions are: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), right inferotemporal cortex, right cuneus extending into precuneus, left cuneus, right superior and middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). We also found increased functional connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right lateral prefrontal cortex in AD. In addition, rightward asymmetry of hippocampal connectivity observed in elderly controls was diminished in AD patients. The disrupted hippocampal connectivity to the MPFC, vACC and PCC provides further support for decreased activity in "default mode network" previously shown in AD. The decreased connectivity between the hippocampus and the visual cortices might indicate reduced integrity of hippocampus-related cortical networks in AD. Moreover, these findings suggest that resting-state fMRI might be an appropriate approach for studying pathophysiological changes in early AD.},
